A lot of what I'm going to say and reference will be from an American Christian perspective, as that's what I know best and I don't want to venture outside of that - but this idea of the hollowing out of religion due to our current technology, I believe, is a current physics. Not held within our specific culture. </p><p><span>The following talk was meant to be a conversation with my partners of this intellectual investigation - </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://x.com/daoudaleonard\">Daouda Leonard</a><span> and </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://x.com/elonrutberg\">Elon Rutberg</a><span> - but I was selected as high priest for Hereticon so hopefully I do this initial probe justice. </span></p><p><strong>FIRST DEFINITION - SecuTech</strong></p><p>Secular Technology, or SecuTech is the current environment. </p><p>It is technology designed and embodied from a post-modernist perspective. </p><p>So to grok this we have to get with two ideas. One is what we believe design even is, and the second is a shared language around post-modernism. </p><p>Design, to take from industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa, is an embodiment of values. And thus products act as a built environment of value assertions. Both by their existence and in the case of many digital technologies - with their every use and app open. </p><p>Post-Modernism is a ever debated thing, but Hans Bertens offers us the following: </p><p>\"If there is a common denominator to all these postmodernisms, it is that of a crisis in representation: a deeply felt loss of faith in our ability to represent the real, in the widest sense. No matter whether they are aesthetic, epistemological, moral, or political in nature, the representations that we used to rely on can no longer be taken for granted.\"</p><p>SecuTech's values that get embodied in design become clear in this lens, and we can map them directly to some of our most powerful companies: </p><p>Crisis of Representation - Social Media </p><p><span>Relativism - Information / </span><em>Disinformation</em><span> &amp; Media Wars (this is feature NOT a bug of postmodernism)</span></p><p>Post Material Values - \"you will own nothing and like it\"-isms - These are the Ubers, Spotify, Netflix, and rent based culture </p><p><strong>SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM - THESE ARE ALL GOOD COMPANIES / INTERESTING ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE CAN ADVANCE FROM</strong></p><p>Well, I believe the stakes are getting much much higher </p><p>What's at stake is the current existential crisis of technology - who will build the AI god (lower case g) first. </p><p><strong>Technologists are obsessed with reaching god (lower case g) AS technology</strong></p><p><strong>Instead reaching God (upper case G) THROUGH technology </strong></p><p>Because what they are searching for are, naturally, the holy properties of God - in the case of AI we search omniscience </p><p>The framework I use  to analyze what's at stake is Marshall McLuhan's \"Technology as Amputation\"</p><p>AI = Omniscient = our own lobotomy </p><p>That should scare all of us. </p><p>I don't ever worry about AI alignment doomsday scenario in a traditional sense - I do worry about being a pile of useless limbs</p><p><strong>LET'S GIVE ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF HOW TO LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY'S DESIGN IMPACT</strong></p><p>I'll utilize McLuhan again, and the framework of the Tetrad. </p><p>Enhance - what does the technology amplify</p><p>Obsolesce - What does it make obsolete</p><p>Retrieve - What does it bring back </p><p>Reverse - What happens when pushed to its limits? </p><p>We can look at a lot of SecuTech in this lens to understand its effects. </p><p>One thing I'm personally disgusted by is the proliferation of Sports Gambling. I actually think there's an argument for it to be considered DemonicTech but let's not do that. </p><p>Mobile Sports Gambling amplifies sports watching. Gets your adrenaline up. </p><p>It obsolesces the gambling house and diamond district bookies a la Uncut Gems.</p><p>It retrieves personal stakes for events that don't involve you. </p><p>And it reverses tribal loyalty (it's not about the team/athlete, it's about my bet).</p><p>I hope that framework makes sense. I'm happy to chat about it with y'all 1:1 but let's keep rocking. </p><p><strong>SO THEN, THE QUESTION SHIFTS - BEYOND AN ARGUMENT OF MORALITY, HOW HAS SecuTech ACTIVELY REDUCED RELIGION</strong></p><p>\"Behavior Crowding\"</p><p>If we only make space for SecuTech we overpower the space for Spiritual Technologies. </p><p><strong>AND WHAT ARE THOSE SPIRITUAL TECHNOLOGIES, LET'S LOOK AT AN OLD  ONE.</strong></p><p>One that I think most folks are familiar with here is the Catholic Rosary. </p><p>And what is the Catholic Rosary. What is the formula? The effect? </p><p>The Rosary is taking time out of day + closing eyes + chanting prayer + repetitive incantation + running fingers over beads + meditating on a mystery + achieving a palpable sense of calm and wonder about life = a far more graciously experienced day</p><p><strong>THERE IS A GOD SHAPED HOLE IN OUR HEART, AND (THIS IS THE HERETICAL MOMENT) IN OUR ECONOMY</strong></p><p>We know the millennial core answers to this God shaped hole. It's \"Soul Cycle\" and the like. But we can't reach God pedaling and not going anywhere. </p><p>There is a statue at the Met that I think about a lot. It's a woman standing incredibly casually, holding a crucifix. And the pose isn't lost by any of the guests that visit, as many of them take photos next to it holding their phone in the same pose. </p><p><span>I genuinely believe our true orientation is towards the divine. We've just been rug pulled for lesser substitutes - and the real devil within SecuTech is the fact no one has really defined it at a high enough abstraction to place Spiritual Technology on the other side of the </span><em>match</em><span> if you will. </span></p><p>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled is making folks believe he doesn't exist type vibe. </p><p><strong>SO LET'S SAY YOU SEE THE PROBLEMS WITH SecuTech AND SEE OLD SPIRITUAL TECH - WHAT ARE WE MEANT TO DO NOW</strong></p><p>The classical technologist in me would say \"it's time to build\"</p><p>But the McLuhanist in me says it's time to help others wake up to this framework. So we are looking to inspire more conversations and experimental probes here - particularly around connected hardware.  </p><p><strong>ONE PARTING POINT</strong></p><p><span>I recently watched the film Conclave, about the electing of a new pope. And in the homily before they enter the session there's a really beautiful statement. That the sin the protagonist is most afraid of is </span><strong>certainty</strong><span> because certainty erodes the need for faith. And faith is the critical point of this.</span></p><p>I think the rational SF technologist is oriented around questions of certainty and truth, and mechanizing those things. </p><p>But the world is far more mystical. Our spiritual condition is real. And I believe the entire point of spiritual technology, from a serious venture lens, is that we need it to help orient us to the personal breakthroughs, so that we may unlock our broader progressive societal breakthroughs. </p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I don’t do edits really, so excuse typos and things that don’t make sense.</p><p>Thanks so much for giving me your attention. I hope it was worth it, if not… unsubscribing will not hurt my feelings, and will give you back time you literally cannot have back.</p><p>Much love.</p><p>Live in the light</p></div></div>",

Or at least, the ending as it stands today. Most of the people involved in this story wind up either dead, maimed, spending months in a mental hospital, languishing in jail, or gone underground. It's a tragedy from almost any angle, especially because, at the outset, most of these people were idealists committed to doing as much good as possible in a world they saw as beset by existential threats. In spite of those aims, or perhaps in pursuit of them, over the course of this story their lives will devolve into senseless violence. And by the time we reach the present, six people will be killed, two others presumed dead by suicide, and at least two in hiding. Countless friends and family members will find themselves bereft. I feel it's only fair to warn you that, in this story, justice and redemption have so far proven hard to come by.</p><p>How did so much go so wrong? When did it begin to fall apart? Trying to answer these questions—as I’ve done for the past two years—is not unlike querying a chatbot powered by a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/\">large language model</a>. The responses you receive depend on the prompts you compose. Ask the question one way, and you might elicit a set of facts adhering to one reality: The emergence of the world’s first AI-inflected death cult, whose obsessions over the prospect of a machine superintelligence eventually sent them spiraling into destruction. Tweak the prompt, and you may produce an entirely different story: of a charismatic, deranged leader spreading a carefully engineered mania to followers seeking purpose in life. Try again, and you could get the tale of a vulnerable <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/lgbtq/\">minority</a>, driven to act at the extremes of their convictions by a society that rejects them.</p><div data-testid=\"NewsletterSubscribeFormWrapper\" data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\"><h3>The Big Story Newsletter: Riveting Deep-Dives</h3><p>Our deepest dives and cutting-edge features that will leave you smarter and sharper. Delivered on Sundays.</p></div><p>But just like the outputs produced by our current AI oracles, some of these narratives turn out to be rife with hallucinations: plausible-<em>sounding</em> visions of reality, but fabricated to fill the need for a greater meaning. The trouble, as I went along, was separating the truth from the delirium. I wasn't always sure that I could. To be honest, I'm still not. But here we are, and a story has to start somewhere.</p><h2>I.</h2><p><span>Let’s begin on</span> an afternoon in mid-November 2019, under the redwood canopy in Northern California, along a road called Bohemian Highway. It was a Friday, and Sergeant Brian Parks of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office was on patrol along the Russian River near the town of Guerneville when a call came over his radio. Someone had dialed 911 from Westminster Woods, a wilderness camp and retreat center about 8 miles away. The caller reported that a group of several people had driven up and blocked the camp's entrance and exit with their vehicles. They'd gotten out and begun some kind of demonstration, clad in black robes and masks.</p><p>Sonoma sheriffs occasionally encounter protesters at Bohemian Grove, a secretive men’s club for powerful elites that also meets in the redwoods near Guerneville, but the county was typically “not a hotbed” for that sort of thing, Parks says. So he thought to himself, “You know what, I'm just going to roll that way,” and steered his car toward Westminster Woods.</p><p>The camp was hosting two groups of visitors that day. One was an alumni gathering for a nonprofit called the Center for Applied Rationality. The Bay Area group ran workshops dedicated to “developing clear thinking for the sake of humanity's future,” as they put it. People within and around CFAR, which tended to attract a cohort of young, technically adept seekers, often called themselves simply “the rationalists.” CFAR was itself an outgrowth of another organization, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, devoted to the technical endeavor of creating artificial intelligence that wouldn't destroy the world.</p><p>Both CFAR and MIRI were the brainchildren of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/\">Eliezer</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/geoffrey-hinton-ai-chatgpt-dangers/\">Yudkowsky</a>, the now famous researcher and AI pessimist who had been warning of AI's dangers for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2001/04/making-hal-your-pal/\">decades</a>. In recent years the two organizations had become intertwined with a third group, the philanthropically minded <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deaths-of-effective-altruism/\">effective altruists</a>. EA, initially focused on maximizing the value in charitable giving, had increasingly taken on MIRI’s views—namely, that the existential risk, or x-risk, posed by “unfriendly” AI trumped all of humanity’s other problems. In the rationalist world, CFAR provided the grand thinking, MIRI the technical know-how, and EA the funding to save humans from being eradicated by runaway machines.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>The other group at Westminster Woods that day was a class of 18 elementary school children attending a ropes course.</p><p>As Parks received updates over the radio, it was the presence of kids that upped the stakes for the sheriff’s department. “The information I was receiving kind of started to raise the hairs on the back of my neck a little bit,” he says. “Because it didn't seem consistent with your typical protest.” A new 911 call reported that one of the demonstrators was carrying a gun. “So at that time I'm thinking it’s one of two things,” Parks says. “Is this going to be an active killer? Or is this going to be a hostage standoff?”</p><p>Parks upgraded the police call to a “code 3”—a lights and sirens emergency—and requested more units as he sped toward the camp. He and one of his deputies, Joseph Ricks, pulled up to the entrance within moments of each other and found the driveway blocked by a red Prius. Down a short hill, Parks saw three figures in full-length black cloaks, wearing Guy Fawkes masks, pacing and chanting. He unholstered his gun.</p><p>This is roughly the point in the story when agreed-upon facts begin to dwindle. In Parks’ account, which he relayed to me in the fall of 2023 at a local Starbucks, the protesters were speaking in unison. “Just stuff I didn't really understand, but it was somewhat rehearsed,” he said. The group had printed flyers outlining their complaints against CFAR and MIRI. They alleged that MIRI had “paid out blackmail (using donor funds)” to quash sexual misconduct accusations and that CFAR's leader “discriminates against trans women.” Other allegations were more esoteric. CFAR did not “appreciably develop novel rationality/mental tech.” The path to avoiding extinction, they wrote, involved “escaping containment by society” through “mental autonomy” and “interhemispheric game theory.”</p><p>None of this would have meant much to Parks. He and Ricks ordered the protesters to get on the ground. As they did, each one called out demanding a same-gender pat down, like one might request at an airport. All three were trans women, but Parks says he couldn't discern their genders because of the robes and masks. Regardless, “they were not going to get that luxury at that point in time,” he told me. “It's like, well, we don’t know if you’re a boy or a girl and we gotta handcuff you.” Parks’ deputies subdued the three in prone positions, what Parks calls “a high-risk-type takedown” requiring more force than “a normal handcuffing style.”</p><p>By now, the police had been told there might be five outsiders on the grounds, including one who was possibly carrying a hatchet. Many of the CFAR alumni hadn’t even arrived at the site, having received emails from organizers that they shouldn’t come. The children and their teachers had taken shelter in buildings on the property. As Parks and another deputy moved across a small bridge toward the camp, another robed figure approached them. When Parks yelled for them to put their hands up, he says, the protester—who was also a trans woman—fell onto her back, as if slipping on ice, then struggled briefly with a deputy while being cuffed.</p><p>Parks had ordered in the SWAT team, which proceeded to evacuate the children and teachers in an armored vehicle. With the help of a helicopter, the police spent hours searching the 200-acre complex for the fifth, armed protester. In the end, there wasn't one. “We later learned that it was actually a maintenance worker who had armed himself with the hatchet,” Parks says. The original reports of protesters carrying weapons had also been false. One had a can of pepper spray, but none of them had a gun.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>The four were transported, handcuffed, to a detention facility in nearby Santa Rosa. Both sides would agree on one final fact: that the protesters refused to cooperate, in any sense. “I know your face!” one said to the officers as they were bundled into the facility. “You are slavers. You are Nazis.”</p><h2>II.</h2><p><span>When the story</span> of the protest broke in the local news the following day, it read at first like a kooky Northern California police blotter tale: robed figures among the redwoods, cops bumbling through the underbrush chasing a phantom accomplice. At the jail, though, the clash between the police and the protesters somehow set in motion a story that would end with one demonstrator dead, one missing, one detained, and one on trial for murder.</p><p>The four protesters—Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Ziz LaSota, and Alex Leatham—had all been involved in various ways with the CFAR, MIRI, and EA communities. But they had refused to give their names to the cops, who eventually used fingerprints to identify them. This meant that in early stories about the arrests, LaSota and Leatham were deadnamed—identified by their birth names rather than their chosen ones.</p><p>To the Sheriff's Office this may have seemed a minor oversight, even an unavoidable one. These were, after all, the names the fingerprints had turned up. But it represented the first crack in what would become a rhetorical and factual fissure between the official narrative and that of the protesters. They would be routinely deadnamed in court documents and proceedings, and even by their own attorneys in conversations with me. (In this story, wherever possible, I'm using their given family names, which none officially changed to my knowledge, and their chosen first names and pronouns, as far as I can discern from their own statements and the blogs I've established that they maintained. However, I do at times quote public officials and records that refer to trans people by the pronouns they were assigned at birth.)</p><p>To the extent that the group had any coherent collective identity, they would come to be known in the rationalist community as “the Zizians.” To the extent they had a leader, it would be perceived as Ziz LaSota. The members of the group never seemed to adopt this name themselves, nor would they accept its implications: that they were a group at all, that they had a leader. But to the people they’d splintered off from, it appeared that all troubles flowed back to LaSota.</p><p>LaSota was a 28-year-old software developer who had grown up in Alaska. By her own description, she was technically gifted from a young age. “My friends and family, even if they think I'm weird, don't seem to be really bothered by the fact that I'm weird,” she wrote in 2014, in the comments of a post on LessWrong.com, the online forum that serves as a discussion hub for rationalist thought. “But one thing I can tell you is that I used to de-emphasize my weirdness around them, and then I stopped, and found that being unapologetically weird is a lot more fun.”</p><p>LaSota began “reading up on EA and x-risk,” she wrote later, as an undergraduate in computer engineering at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. That’s also when she was “starting to donate to MIRI.” She interned at the software giant Oracle and at NASA, developing a tool for space weather analysis. But around the time she graduated, she began to wonder whether she should commit to graduate school in computer science or pursue a job as a computer engineer and “earn to give”—the effective altruism term for making as much money as possible in order to donate it. (The concept is now most attached to convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, but at the time it was still novel, as the EA movement took off in the Bay Area.)</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>LaSota writes that she contacted Anna Salamon, the executive director of CFAR, to ask for advice. According to LaSota’s account, Salamon “said actually I should go to grad school, find a startup cofounder, drop out and earn to give via startups instead.” (Salamon declined to comment for this story.) After attending grad school for a while and then dropping out—without snagging a cofounder—LaSota moved to the Bay Area and worked for a gaming company, then a biological instruments startup.</p><p>Disenchanted with what she viewed as the hollowness of startup culture, LaSota increasingly turned to the rationalist community for answers. Since the early 2000s, when Yudkowsky had started gathering like-minded individuals to warn about the dangers of AI, the community had evolved from a largely technical movement to a social one. At workshops, in group houses, and on LessWrong.com, rationalists engaged in extended philosophical debate about AI, game theory, the singularity (in which a superintelligence would arise in one, instantaneous moment), and how to live a more rational life.</p><p>Much of their discussion, online and off, was obscure. Partly this was the result of the technical concepts underpinning theories about the future of AI. But the arcane language around “infohazards,” “basilisks,” or “Schelling points” also served a more exclusive purpose. It was a lexicon required for acceptance into a kind of priesthood, a self-declared bulwark against the destruction of humanity itself.</p><p>LaSota dove into the debates, sometimes passionately enough to alarm her fellow rationalists—many of whom she increasingly regarded, in at least one respect, as morally repellent. “I'd been a vegan first,” she later wrote, “and my primary concern upon learning about the singularity was how do I make this benefit all sentient life, not just humans. I described my feelings towards flesh-eating monsters, who had created hell on Earth [for] more people than those they had helped.” (In Ziz’s writing, anyone who eats meat is a “flesh-eating monster,” and sentient animals are “people.”)</p><p>In 2016, LaSota attended an eight-day CFAR program called the Workshop on AI Safety Strategy. One event included a session of “‘doom circles,’” she later wrote, where each participant “took turns having everyone else bluntly but compassionately say why they were doomed” and also weighed in themselves. The session elicited difficult soul searching from LaSota about whether she was “morally valuable” and “net positive” to Earth—whether her life would contribute to saving humanity at all. “When it was my turn,” LaSota wrote, “I said my doom was that I could succeed at the things I tried, succeed exceptionally well, like I bet I could in 10 years have earned to give like 10 million dollars through startups, and it would still be too little too late, and ultimately the world would still burn.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"><figure><p><span>ILLUSTRATION: HOKYOUNG KIM</span></p></figure></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><h2>III.</h2><p><span>The Zizians came</span> together over the next two years, splintering off one by one from the established rationalist and EA communities. Gwen Danielson, a high-achieving prep school graduate from Washington state who’d studied electrical engineering, math, and cognitive science at Rice University, met LaSota in the mid-2010s. They bonded over their experiences in the soul-sucking Bay Area real estate market, which often shunted rationalist-curious arrivals into toxic group-living situations or debt. “Most of the money donated by earn-to-givers [was] going to landlords,” Danielson wrote. “We both recognized housing as one of the most obvious problems with the Bay area rationalist community.”</p><p>In 2016, the pair began living together on a small sailboat Danielson owned, in the Berkeley Marina. LaSota, after learning some sailing basics, bought her own 24-foot boat for $600 off Craigslist. She named it the <em>Black Cygnet</em> and began living on it. From there, the pair decided to expand their life at sea and create “a federated fleet of boats” that would provide housing for rationalists “in order to improve the rate of work on AI safety.” They’d call it the Rationalist Fleet. Danielson, LaSota, and a third comrade purchased a 70-year-old Navy tugboat that had been christened <em>Caleb</em>, and LaSota traveled to Alaska to sail it down, together with acquaintances she’d recruited via online rationalist groups.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Ninety-four feet long and striped with rust, the boat was fraught with problems from the beginning. LaSota and Danielson managed to reach the Bay Area with it but had trouble finding a cheap place to anchor. They became consumed with the struggle to keep the vessel seaworthy. Marooned for days and weeks onboard, pondering their deteriorating surroundings, they began creating their own unique philosophies. “We’ve been somewhat isolated from the rationalist community for a while,” LaSota wrote to a correspondent at the time, “and in the course developed a significant chunk of unique art of rationality and theories of psychology aimed at solving our problems.”</p><p>As LaSota articulated it, their goals had moved beyond real estate into a more grandiose realm. “We are trying to build a cabal,” she wrote. The aim was “to find abnormally intrinsically good people and turn them all into Gervais-sociopaths, creating a fundamentally different kind of group than I have heard of existing before.” (The Gervais principle, articulated by the writer Venkatesh Rao—based on an extensive but light-hearted analysis of <em>The Office</em>—is a theory that at the top of any organization are “sociopaths” who know how to acquire and manipulate power. Beneath them are the loyal “clueless” and the disaffected “losers.”) Sociopathy, LaSota wrote, would allow the group’s members to operate “unpwned by the external world.”</p><p>“Gervais-sociopaths” was a foundational concept in LaSota’s increasingly tangled ideology, the kind that went beyond even the most impenetrable thinking found on LessWrong.com. On her blog, at Sinceriously.fyi, she outlined that ideology across 100,000 words over several years, on topics ranging from engineering, to her personal history, to psychological manipulation, to gender theory, to the future motivations of a superior artificial intelligence.</p><p>I have read this corpus in its entirety more than once, and attempting to summarize LaSota’s or Zizian thought by quoting from it is an almost impossible exercise. It would be akin to explaining a person’s life by examining remnants of charred photos salvaged from a house consumed by fire. To a reader unstudied in rationalist-inflected thought—and even to many at the time who were—the blog could read like the work of an intelligent but unhinged mind:</p><p><em>Good is at an inherent disadvantage in epistemic drinking contests. But we have an advantage: I am actually willing to die to advance good.</em></p><p><em>At one point, I saw a married couple, one of them doing AI alignment research, who were planning to have a baby. They agreed that the researcher would also sleep in the room with the crying baby in the middle of the night, not to take any load off the other. Just a signal of some kind. Make things even. And I realized that I was no longer able to stand people.</em></p><p><em>Liches have trouble thinking clearly about paths through probability space that conflict with their phylactery, and the more conjunctive a mission it is to make true their phylactery, the more bits of epistemics will be corrupted by their refusal to look into that abyss.</em></p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>However opaque LaSota’s ideology may have seemed to outsiders, there were some in the rationalist community who felt its pull—including her shipmate Danielson, Emma Borhanian, and Alex Leatham. Borhanian was a former Google engineer; Leatham had studied mathematics at UC Berkeley and UCLA. To them, the normies who dismissed Ziz were no different than the friends and family who failed to understand the implications of AI superintelligence.</p><p>LaSota and her compatriots, who’d bought into the need for sentient life to be saved from AI, increasingly found MIRI and CFAR insufficiently committed to that mission. “They are obviously not taking heroic responsibility for the outcome of this world,” Danielson wrote. At best, the Bay Area organizations were doing “niche research.” At worst, they were actively corrupt, even abusive. LaSota and those in her orbit alleged that CFAR and its leadership were laced with anti-trans beliefs and practices. (“That's preposterous,” one member of the rationalist community, who is also trans, told me. “Rationalists have the most trans people of any group I've seen that isn't explicitly about being trans. You'd just show up at a math event or house party, and it would be 20 percent trans.”)</p><p>Within the labyrinth of LaSota’s writing, even the most perplexed reader could locate the essence of her aspiration: to attain a hero’s role, with a commitment to an unassailable moral code. She yearned for action in support of that code, the kind of action that most humans—and rationalists—lacked the moral fortitude to pursue.</p><p>So the group set about trying to “install” new “mental tech,” as they described it, to “jailbreak” their minds from convention. They began wearing all black, identifying their philosophy as “vegan anarchotranshumanism” and their spiritual beliefs as “vegan sith.” (“The Sith do what they want deep down,” LaSota explained. “They remove all obstructions to that.”)</p><p>Danielson developed an elaborate psychological theory around brain hemispheres, soon taken up by LaSota. A person’s core consisted of two hemispheres, each one intrinsically good or nongood. In extremely rare cases they could be “double good”—a condition that, it so happened, LaSota identified in herself. A person’s two hemispheres could be at war with each other, but it was possible to gain awareness and even control of them through a process called “debucketing.” LaSota and Danielson began experimenting with something they called “unihemispheric sleep,” which they believed allowed them to put portions of their brain into slow wave sleep while remaining consciously awake. It was, LaSota wrote, “a means of keeping restless watch while alone.”</p><p>In their four months on the boat, however, LaSota and Danielson’s theorizing seemed to outpace their seafaring skills. In November 2017, the Coast Guard had to retrieve <em>Caleb</em> after the 345-ton tug dragged its anchor and collided with other boats in the harbor, while carrying hundreds of gallons of oily bilge water. Ultimately the vessel became too expensive to maintain, and the group abandoned it. (In 2022, the operators of Pillar Point Harbor in San Mateo, where <em>Caleb</em> had been left behind, spent more than $50,000 to tow the boat back out to sea. One month later, it sank.) “After Rationalist Fleet I updated away from boats being a good idea for housing,” Danielson wrote, “in favor of well-outfitted stealth RVs.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>For now, the friends seemed scattered and vulnerable, with tenuous housing and social worlds in flux. “I was kind of homeless,” Leatham later wrote of the time. But they were increasingly united around the idea of taking action. “I de-facto lead without authority,” LaSota wrote. “Just like I did a lot of in Rationalist Fleet even though Gwen was the boss formally (and the high level strategic vision as well, actually). Real leaders don’t need authority.”</p><h2>IV.</h2><p><span>By the day</span> of the CFAR reunion at Westminster Woods, in November 2019, the schism between the rationalist mothership and LaSota’s small faction had taken a more aggressive turn. The splinter group had suggested they could sue over what they believed to be anti-trans discrimination by CFAR’s leaders and had become verbally confrontational online and at CFAR meetups.</p><p>To the larger rationalist community, their writing seemed increasingly unhinged, even threatening. “Vengeance and justice are in the hands of anyone who wants it,” Leatham wrote. “You don’t need to appeal to anyone to take revenge.” Salamon, CFAR’s executive director, later wrote on Facebook that she’d begun to feel “extreme fear” toward LaSota. She recalled that LaSota had posted to Discord, “If MIRI attempts to silence me using governmental force … that would be physical violence. If they escalate to physical violence, we are prepared to perform self-defense.”</p><p>There were Byzantine levels to this inter-community drama that defy summary, played out across endless threads on Discord, LessWrong, and Tumblr. As self-described vegan Siths, LaSota and Danielson expressed outrage that MIRI’s efforts to create human-friendly AI didn’t seem to include other animals in the equation.</p><p>The group had become especially fixated on a particular rumor, namely that the nonprofit MIRI had potentially used donor money to pay off a former staffer. The ex-employee had launched a website accusing MIRI leaders of statutory rape and a coverup. Though the facts were never litigated in a courtroom, MIRI’s president wrote in 2019 that he had checked “some of the most serious allegations” and “found them to be straightforwardly false.” The website’s owner had agreed to retract the claims and take the site down, the president said, under conditions that were confidential. But what angered LaSota and Danielson was as much the idea—in their minds at least—that the nonprofit had succumbed to blackmail as the allegations themselves. In negotiating, they believed, the organization had violated one of its fundamental principles: “timeless decision theory,” a concept developed by MIRI cofounder Eliezer Yudkowsky. (Yudkowsky, who later renamed it “functional decision theory,” declined to comment for this story.)</p><p>Without getting mired in the details—which, unfortunately, are extremely difficult to distill without getting into game theory—suffice it to say: Timeless decision theory asserts that, in making a decision, a person should consider not just the outcome of that specific choice but also their own underlying patterns of reasoning—and those of their past and future selves (not least because these patterns might one day be anticipated by an omniscient, adversarial AI). LaSota, in her writing, seems to have interpreted this metaphysical game as a call to operate “timelessly”—to treat one’s choices as if they affected the fate of all sentient life across temporal horizons. Under this line of thinking, one should never back down or surrender, no matter what. In any case, the Zizians believed that timeless decision theorists are supposed to resist blackmail, and they perceived this purported betrayal of principle as deeper than the crime itself.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>According to Danielson’s later writing, the group planned a series of talks to communicate all of this at the Westminster Woods reunion. Days before, however, CFAR’s leadership barred Danielson and LaSota from attending. So they arrived instead in their robes and masks, three-page flyers in hand. “MIRICFAR betrayed us,” the flyers read in part. “It is not what it once seemed like it would become. New things can be built.”</p><h2>V.</h2><p><span>Following their arrests,</span> each of the four spent several days in jail before bailing out. Prosecutors charged them with five misdemeanors, for crimes like false imprisonment of the campers, willful cruelty to a child, and wearing a mask for an “unlawful purpose.” They also layered on a felony, for conspiracy, that carried the threat of serious prison time.</p><p>But LaSota and the other three, on their blogs and in legal briefs, cast themselves as the victims. In their defense filings, the group argued that they’d traveled to Westminster Woods “to protest the cover-up of the sexual abuse of minors” by CFAR. They couldn’t have known that the elementary school children would also be on the property or that camp staffers would interpret their protest as an active shooter situation. They accused the police of filing false reports and the county district attorney of “malicious prosecution” on “trumped-up criminal charges.”</p><p>“Don't we know by now that the word of a cop isn't worth shit?” Michelle Zajko, another young trans rationalist who traveled in the group’s circles but hadn’t attended the protest, wrote later. The false gun claim and police presence, she wrote, were “a fairly standard example of a phenomenon called ‘swatting’ where someone deceives emergency services into sending police based on false reporting.”</p><p>The group hired a lawyer and filed a civil rights complaint against the Sonoma County authorities on the grounds that they’d been subjected to excessive force and that their requests for same-gender searches had been ignored. The searches the male officers had conducted, including under their clothing, they alleged, “amounted to sexual assault and battery.” After being brought to the jail, the complaint alleged, the group had their clothing “forcibly stripped off their bodies.” They said the officers then “crowded around to look at the Claimants’ genitals and naked bodies.” They were then “tortured” over a number of days, they said, “woken whenever they started to fall asleep … and were kept naked and cold for days.”</p><p>With the arrival of the pandemic, both cases slowed to a crawl, and the group seemed to grow more isolated and inward-looking. Their collective exile from the rationalist community was virtually complete. They were banned from LessWrong.com, along with various CFAR meetups and conferences. An anonymous rationalist launched a site, Zizians.info, branding them “the Zizians” for the first time and warning that the group was a cult. The page, which LaSota called “a rationalist smear site,” alleged that LaSota’s unihemispheric sleep practices had led to the 2018 suicide of a trans woman attached to the group, Maia Pasek. (LaSota wrote that unihemispheric sleep “did not doom Pasek.” But her own description of her interactions with Pasek, titled “Pasek’s Doom” and including lines like “We each went on our journey of jailbreaking into psychopathy fully” and “Pasek’s right hemisphere had been ‘mostly-dead,’” did little to rebut the accusations.)</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Whatever thread of attachment they’d felt to the rationalists was snapped by the response to the protests. “‘Rationalists’” are so evil,\" Leatham wrote. “i dont know how to express how evil they are. many of them are just authoritarians … Not a single ‘rationalist’ cisfem stood up for me … i wont forget this.”</p><p>Parts of the rationalist community had become increasingly concerned about what LaSota and her acolytes might do next. “Do you know whether Ziz owns or has easy access to any weapons?” one member wrote on Facebook. “Does she currently have a plan to obtain a weapon?” A moderator on LessWrong wrote that “both Ziz and Gwen have a sufficient track record of being aggressive offline (and Ziz also online) that I don’t really want them around on LessWrong or to provide a platform to them.” One rationalist recalled that “CFAR spent a bunch of money hiring professional security.”</p><p>In turn, LaSota and the others wrote of vengeance against the “timeless” decisions of others. “If you truly irreconcilably disagree with someone's creative choice, i.e. their choice extending arbitrarily far into the past and future, ultimately your only recourse is to kill them,” one LaSota ally wrote in a long blog post citing Ziz’s philosophies. In the comments, LaSota wrote, “I am so fucking glad to finally have an equal.”</p><p>In the spring of 2021, a rationalist named Jay Winterford, who went by the name Fluttershy, died by suicide. Winterford had spent time on <em>Caleb</em> with LaSota and Danielson, where LaSota had described trying to “fix/upgrade” him, and for years he seemingly grappled with LaSota’s ideas as a way out of childhood traumas. To rationalist watchers of the group, Winterford seemed to constitute a second casualty of its ideology.</p><p>In court, by summer 2021, the four had turned against their own defense lawyers, accusing one of misconduct. A month later, representing herself, Leatham filed to have the state judge Shelly Averill disqualified from the case on the grounds that she had “repeatedly misgendered me and my codefendants, including twice under penalty of perjury, and 10 times on the first court date after my writ petition where I told her misgendering me was bias and misconduct.” (Judge Averill admitted to misgendering Leatham but replied that she did not “misspeak intentionally or in any way intend to cause party offense.” A higher court ruled against Leatham.)</p><p>Another Leatham filing included numbered objections like “2. Shelly Averill is evil.” “3. Shelly Averill has read my previous accusation that she is evil and has not denied that she is evil.” “5. … Shelly Averill has omnicidal intent—she wants to destroy everything—especially prioritizing that which is good.” And “11. I will never be a man, no matter how much humans like Shelly Averill want to eradicate that truth from existence.”</p><p>When their civil rights complaint for harassment and torture was thrown out, the four filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the police and two administrators at Westminster Woods—whom they accused of intentionally fabricating the claim that one of them was armed, in order to prompt a stronger police response. They again asserted that the police had infringed on their speech, sexually assaulted them, and denied them food and medication in custody, amounting to torture. The police opposed a subpoena to release any video from the jail, calling them “privileged” files that would constitute “an undue burden” to sort through.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Even mired in their ongoing legal battles, the group still seemed to be expanding. Now hovering around the Zizian orbit was a figure named Alice Monday—whom LaSota had described as “sort of a mentor to me”—and Michelle Zajko, the young rationalist who compared the Westminster Woods response to a swatting. She was trans nonbinary and a recent bioinformatics master’s graduate from Pennsylvania. By the spring of 2022, an EA adherent and recent UC Berkeley student with chunky black glasses named Daniel Blank was also around. Blank, a cisgender man whose blog showed him captivated by LaSota’s ideas, was noted in the court file as having delivered one of Leatham’s lengthy objections to the court.</p><p>A few weeks later, after Danielson failed to show up for a hearing, Averill issued a bench warrant for her arrest. Then, at a hearing of the federal lawsuit, on August 19, the group’s attorney asked for a stay in the case. He said he believed that Gwen Danielson had died by suicide.</p><p>One half of the founding Zizian brain trust was apparently gone. The other was soon to vanish as well.</p></div><div data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"><figure><p><span>ILLUSTRATION: HOKYOUNG KIM</span></p></figure></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><h2>VI.</h2><p><span>Out on the</span> waters of San Francisco Bay that night of August 19, 2022, it was balmy and breezy, with a light swell. At 11:05, the Coast Guard command center in San Francisco received a distress call from a woman on a boat traveling south across the bay. The woman, Naomi LaSota, reported that her 31-year-old brother had fallen overboard, somewhere south of the Bay Bridge. Naomi, Ziz, and Borhanian had gone out for an afternoon sail on Ziz LaSota’s boat, the <em>Black Cygnet</em>. But as they were heading back to the marina, Naomi reported, her brother—as she referred to Ziz in her communications with the Coast Guard—had leaned over the motor and fallen in.</p><p>According to official Coast Guard logs obtained through a Freedom of Information Act Request, the sister said her brother had not been wearing a life preserver, and she was “unable to determine exact location or area where brother fell overboard due to unfamiliarity with the boat.”</p><p>The Coast Guard deployed in force, knowing that time was of the essence. All available boats, helicopters, planes, and drones launched into action, including the marine rescue units of the Oakland and Alameda fire departments.</p><p>The crews searched through the night, obtaining “fatigue waivers” to forgo their normal shifts to keep going. They ran patterns through the Bay out under the Golden Gate Bridge, from Yerba Buena Island all the way to Land’s End and back down the shore through San Francisco. They returned with only “negative results,” in search-and-rescue-speak. There was no sign of the person who’d fallen overboard.</p><p>At 3 am, LaSota’s sister called for assistance again. After the Coast Guard boats had moved on to where LaSota might have drifted, the other two had no idea how to sail back, and the <em>Black Cygnet</em> was now drifting near some rocks. A Coast Guard unit was diverted from the search to tow it into a marina. By 9 am, the operations center had coordinated with the missing boater’s other next of kin. At around 5 pm, after 18 hours, the Coast Guard told LaSota’s family that they were suspending the search. Their computer modeling, they said, showed LaSota could not have survived that long in the water.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>More than two weeks later, an obituary appeared for LaSota in The Daily News-Miner, in Fairbanks. “Loving adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals, you are missed,” it read. That November, Naomi filed to obtain a death certificate for LaSota, with affidavits from herself and Borhanian recounting the incident, both of them using LaSota’s given, legal name. “No friends or family,” she wrote, had seen or heard from LaSota since August 19, 2022.</p><h2>VII.</h2><p><span>With LaSota and</span> Danielson both presumed dead, the Zizian ideology started to feel like an afterthought in the rationalist community. Even before Danielson’s reported suicide and LaSota’s disappearance, some of the leading lights of rationalist thinking had taken to LessWrong to publicly discuss what the experiences around Ziz had meant, as if she no longer existed. “Ziz tried to create an anti-CFAR/MIRI splinter group whose members had mental breakdowns,” Scott Alexander, the author of the prominent Slate Star Codex blog, wrote in a lengthy discussion of MIRI, CFAR, and other mental health incidents that had taken place in the community. Another poster wrote: “The splinter group seems to have selected for high scrupulosity and not attenuated its mental impact.”</p><p>As for others who had been part of LaSota’s Bay Area circle, Michelle Zajko and Alice Monday appeared to have moved to the East Coast. Voter rolls from 2022 show them residing in Coventry, Vermont, on a 20-acre wooded property in an unfinished house, purchased more than one year earlier through an anonymous trust.</p><p>The two remaining Westminster Woods protesters, Borhanian and Leatham, had taken up a precarious residence on a property in Vallejo, northeast of San Francisco. Owned by an 80-year-old former shipworker and crane operator named Curtis Lind, the fenced-off land was pressed up against a steep hillside. Dotted with box trucks, decommissioned boats, and piles of junk, it gave the impression of a salvage yard. It was in a rough corner of town, a friend of Lind’s recalled—the site of drug dealings and shootings. On the opposite side of the hill was a waterfront featuring derelict boats and a regular homeless encampment.</p><p>Lind had decided to monetize the property; he brought in RVs and shipping containers and took on tenants to work and live cheaply in them. But the property lacked water or electricity. According to the friend, Lind had once blown out the neighborhood transformer by tapping it for power.</p><p>Borhanian and Leatham lived in an RV on the property and remained occupied with fighting the charges stemming from the protest. Each court filing of Leatham’s, who was by now attempting to represent herself, became harder to follow. In September 2022 she filed one titled “Notion of Motion and Motion to Dismiss the Imposter Police Officer From all Conflicting Positions on this Case, Including but not Limited to Their Witnessed Reincarnations as Judge and District Attorney.”</p><p>There were other characters hanging around Borhanian and Leatham at the property, including a mysterious blond woman and another young rationalist named Suri Dao—who identified as “bi-gender” and blogged that she “preferred either she/her or he/him pronouns.” The group’s lease had been arranged years before by Gwen Danielson. But Lind claimed that no one had paid rent in years. By October he’d won a $60,000 judgement against the group and was working to evict them.</p><p>What took place between the remaining group and Lind one Sunday morning that November would once again bisect reality into two irreconcilable versions. According to the account that Lind gave police—and that his tenant Patrick McMillan gave the local news—the group learned that the county sheriff would be pursuing the eviction on November 15. On the morning of the 13th, Lind later alleged, Dao lured him out to their trailer by saying there was a water leak, then multiple figures stabbed him with kitchen knives more than a dozen times, including through the eye. At some point Lind pulled a gun, and Leatham allegedly ran a samurai sword through his left shoulder and out from his stomach. Lind fired, killing Borhanian and wounding Leatham at least twice.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>McMillan claimed he awoke to a knock at his door and found Lind standing at his trailer with the sword still protruding from his body. “He said, ‘I’m dying!’ and he had blood squirting out of him,” McMillan told a local TV news reporter a few days later. “I guess they figured if they killed him, they couldn’t be evicted.”</p><p>When the police arrived, they found Borhanian dead, Leatham with gunshot wounds, and Lind bleeding from his eye with a sword sticking through his chest. The cops arrested Dao at the scene, while Leatham and Lind were both transported to the hospital. The blond friend of the group, who police said gave her name as Julia Dawson, was taken to the station for questioning. But after having what appeared to be a medical emergency, she was sent to the hospital as well. From there, she quietly slipped away.</p><p>When Leatham recovered from her injuries enough for the case to proceed, she and Dao were charged with the attempted murder of Lind and the felony murder of their own friend, Borhanian. (Although Lind had pulled the trigger, California law allows prosecutors to essentially charge instigators of a conflict with any murder that results from it.) Lind, among other injuries, lost an eye.</p><p>At least in the small group of supporters who showed up for Dao and Leatham at court hearings, another version of events took hold. Lind, according to this story, had been threatening and harassing the tenants for months, and that morning had entered their home and shot them unprompted. (It’s unclear, in this account, how Lind was stabbed through the chest and eye.) “Emma was no harm to anything or anyone,” a person close to Borhanian said in a 2022 interview, alleging that Lind’s story had changed over time. The group was being presumed guilty because they were neurodiverse, she said. “This man ended the life of this brilliant, brilliant woman.”</p><p>As the murder charges entered their long slog through the California courts, the other cases involving the original four protesters fell away. The protest charges were put on hold, and the group’s attorney in the federal civil rights lawsuit—which alleged the four were “tortured” after Westminster Woods—was preparing to withdraw from the case, saying he could no longer reach his clients. (The case was later dismissed.)</p><p>Two days after the sword attack, the Vallejo police contacted the Coast Guard command center to follow up on its missing boater case. One of the people who’d been on the boat when LaSota went missing, Emma Borhanian, been shot and killed in the Lind attack, they reported. But they had another startling discovery to share. LaSota herself was alive and had been living in Vallejo “for the past six months,” the detective said. Julia Dawson, the woman who’d slipped away from the hospital, was Ziz LaSota.</p></div><div data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"><figure><p><span>ILLUSTRATION: HOKYOUNG KIM</span></p></figure></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><h2>VIII.</h2><p><span>Michelle Zajko grew</span> up in an upscale neighborhood in the town of Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, just southwest of Philadelphia. A sharp and creative student who penned her own fantasy stories, she first became involved in the effective altruism movement as an undergraduate biology major at nearby Cabrini University, bringing an EA discussion group to campus. “I want to help save people for my career, but this is a way I can do it now,” she told her college newspaper in 2013. The same year, Zajko presented a paper about applying Bayesian decision theory in everyday life. “Because people maintain consistency in their beliefs, they often continue to make the same decisions, even if those decisions are not optimal,” she wrote. “Structuring one's decisionmaking strategies in accordance with mathematics and decision theory would result in outcomes that grant higher expected utility than using no strategies.” She earned a master’s degree in bioinformatics from Temple University and worked as an intern at NASA and at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>By 2019, Zajko—known as Jamie in Ziz-connected circles—relocated to California, where she entered the wider rationalist social scene and started dating Alice Monday. (Monday couldn’t be located for this story.) Monday was a controversial figure, accused on multiple blogs of physically and mentally abusing her housemates. Alex Leatham wrote that “about once a week for several months [Monday] would take a length of bamboo and beat my friend emma with it. this is their attempted new order.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Monday never responded publicly to the accusations, and Zajko seemed not to have complaints of her own. “I had spoken with her while she was out in California, and she was very happy,” her aunt Rosanne Zajko told me. “She said that she and her girlfriend, Alice, would be moving to Vermont.” The Bay Area was expensive—“I think she used the word ‘soul-crushing,’” Rosanne said, “and they were looking for a change of scenery.” Monday and Zajko relocated together to Vermont by early 2021.</p><p>The Vermont property was isolated, just 20 miles from the Canadian border. “Long driveway and mountain top setting is really what sets this apart from most homes, total solitude,” a real estate listing noted. Rosanne says that Zajko became increasingly estranged from her family after she arrived in Vermont—an estrangement Rosanne attributes to Zajko’s California friends, including LaSota. “Michelle is a very very intelligent person,” Rosanne said. “She's always been a very independent thinker, someone who is intellectually curious. I see how she goes out there and wants to learn more, but how she actually got to fall under the influence of that group is something I do not understand and I have no answers for.”</p><p>In her online writings, Zajko expressed growing concern about anti-trans sentiments she saw in the news. “We’re already past the start of a trans genocide,” she wrote on her Tumblr in 2022. “If you don’t own a gun, consider getting one, learning to shoot it, and investigating community self-defense. Fascist militias are an arm of the anti-trans genocide who are acting as low-level enforcers.” She also alluded to what she described as past “abuse” by her parents. They’d threatened to go to a judge friend and have her put in foster care, even kill her if she ran away, she wrote. She said she’d “tried explaining” it to her aunt, Rosanne. “She sadly didn’t believe me,” Zajko wrote. “Some people don’t want to hear about the ugliness in the world, because then they’d feel obligated to do something about it.”</p><p>Rosanne’s recollection of these same events, and of Zajko’s parents, was irreconcilable with what her niece wrote. Some time after seeing the posts, she emailed Michelle. “I take issue with one of your posts where you said I knew about abuse but preferred to do nothing,” Rosanne wrote. “That was a huge surprise to me. I felt that you stabbed me in the back with that comment.” Rosanne had been a witness to disputes between Michelle and her parents, she said—even taken Michelle’s side—but said the arguments she knew of never amounted to anything approaching abuse. “Did she express to me any resentment or anger or hate against her parents? Not at all.”</p><p>In 2021, Michelle Zajko bought another half acre of land in Derby, 15 miles from Coventry. It’s unclear how long Monday and Zajko stayed together in Vermont. But in February 2022, Zajko blogged about having recently had long conversations with LaSota. The latter had accused Zajko of, essentially, gossiping about her with Monday and playing mind games. “Ziz informed me that the only way I could gain her trust and make up for what I did to her,” Zajko alleged, “was to murder Alice.” LaSota, according to the post, had told her how to construct a DIY suppressor for a gun and suggested lye to get rid of the body. “And if I didn't do it,” she continued, “Ziz planned to drive across the entire continental United States to murder me.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Zajko seemed to vacillate between suspecting it might all be a rhetorical game and genuinely believing Ziz intended to kill her and Monday both. “Ziz, like myself, does not forgive or forget, not even after years have passed,” she wrote. “While I have the tenacity, skill, and willingness to evade Ziz and her friends indefinitely, it’s a waste of resources. We're currently facing the collapse of civilization, a looming civil war, unfriendly AI, and a fuckton of other threats, and instead of focusing on those, we’re wasting resources respectively hunting and evading each other.”</p><p>The conversation seemed unresolved. But between musings on <em>Dune</em> and Siths, Zajko drew what would later come to feel like a crucial distinction: between the “the world where I'm a complete psycopath [sic],” killing to please Ziz, and the one “where I kill my abuser.”</p><h2>IX.</h2><p><span>Back in Chester</span> Heights, Pennsylvania, Michelle Zajko’s parents lived in the stately four-bedroom home they’d owned since the late 1980s. Richard and Rita Zajko had raised Michelle there, in a cul-de-sac development with other young families. Richard worked for a company that had a contract with the nearby Navy yard, while Rita stayed home. Now that Michelle, an only child, was out of the house and the couple was in their late sixties and early seventies, their life was quiet, arranged around a tight circle of concern. Rita’s parents were ill and lived nearby, said Rosanne, and a lot of Rita and Richard’s time “was taken up in caring for them.”</p><p>Toward the end of 2022, Rosanne had fallen into the habit of talking to Rita every Sunday. “We were both caregivers,” she said—Rita for her parents, and now Rosanne for her husband, Rick’s brother, who was on the verge of entering memory care. “It was grueling and draining,” she said, and she knew Rita could understand.</p><p>“On December 31, I put it out there in the universe: Can 2023 be the year where I have no catastrophes?” Rosanne recalled thinking. “Can it be a good year?” The next morning she texted Rita to wish her a happy New Year but received no reply.</p><p>Three days later, Rosanne said, she got a call from another of Rick’s brothers. “I don’t know why he would be calling, but let me pick it up,” she remembered thinking. “He just comes out with it and says ‘Rick and Rita have been murdered.’”</p><p>Sometime late on New Year’s Eve, the police later determined, someone had killed the couple inside their home, shooting them each in the head with a 9mm handgun. There was no sign of a break-in, and the authorities quickly concluded that the assailant must be someone the couple knew. According to a search warrant application in the case, Ring camera footage from across the street had captured a car pulling up to the house at 11:29 that night. Two minutes later, “a higher-pitched voice is heard shouting what sounds like ‘Mom!’” followed by “Oh my god! Oh God! God!” Two figures are then recorded entering the house, then exiting nine minutes later and driving away.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>The Zajkos, two sources familiar with the case later confirmed to me, had been killed in Michelle’s childhood bedroom. December 31 was her birthday.</p><p>Rosanne was devastated. “I stayed on the floor,” she says. “I wasn't comprehending it: How can this happen to Rita and Rick, of all people?” She wondered briefly why Michelle hadn’t called to deliver the news. “Like, she has to know, but why didn’t she call and tell us?” she remembers thinking. But then she thought: “How would I react if I got the news that both of my parents were murdered? I would be in shock.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"><figure><p><span>ILLUSTRATION: HOKYOUNG KIM</span></p></figure></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><h2>X.</h2><p><span>Three days after</span> the bodies were discovered, on January 5, a pair of Pennsylvania state troopers traveled to Vermont to interview Michelle Zajko. They found her at the Coventry property, along with the 24-year-old Daniel Blank—the rationalist from Berkeley who had once delivered court documents for Alex Leatham.</p><p>One of the troopers, Matthew Gibson, later testified that Zajko told them she was “uncertain of when she would come back to the Commonwealth in order to make final arrangements for her parents.” According to the search warrant affidavit, she told the troopers she hadn’t spoken to her parents since the previous January, that she’d been in Vermont with Blank on New Year’s Eve, and that she hadn’t been to Pennsylvania since before the Covid pandemic.</p><p>The officers asked Zajko if she had any guns on the property. She said they did, and retrieved a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson. Gibson testified that he “held it in Vermont” and “inspected it.” Two sources also confirmed to me that the troopers had seen a shooting range on the property and that the Pennsylvania State Police had discovered that Zajko and the others had turned their phones off in the hours leading up to the murder, making it difficult to track their whereabouts. With no warrant to confiscate the gun, however, Gibson handed it back, and the officers returned home.</p><p>On January 9, the Pennsylvania State Police got a call from the medical examiner in Delaware County. Zajko had arrived unexpectedly, seeking death certificates for her parents. The police tracked her to a nearby hotel called Candlewood Suites, but waited to approach her again.</p><p>On the morning of January 12, Michelle arrived alone at the small graveside ceremony for her parents. Wearing a mask, she told Rosanne she’d been ill and didn’t want to spread germs. Rosanne recalls her seeming paranoid, gesturing at some of Rick’s former colleagues she didn’t recognize. “Who are those men?” she asked.</p><p>Then, at 9 pm that evening, the police arrived at the hotel. They’d secured a warrant to obtain Zajko’s DNA and search her hotel room and car for the Smith &amp; Wesson—“believed to potentially be the murder weapon of Richard and Rita Zajko,” Gibson testified.</p><p>When Zajko came to the door of her second-floor room, she acknowledged the officers but was slow to open it. The police used a key card to enter. They detained Zajko and took her down to the lobby, but as they passed through, she shouted at the hotel staff to tell Daniel Blank that she’d been arrested. “He’s staying in room 111!” she said, according to Gibson. The trooper recognized Blank’s name from the Vermont trip and gathered some officers to approach 111, which Blank had rented under the name “Daniel Black.” When Gibson knocked on the door, Blank refused to open it and asked for a lawyer.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Instead, the officers left to obtain a warrant. They reviewed the previous night’s footage from the Candlewood Suites security cameras and determined that Zajko had carried a bag down to room 111, knocked, and left it outside the door. A judge found it sufficient probable cause for a warrant, and the police returned to the hotel at 12:30 am. This time, when no one answered the door to 111, a vice unit breached the room. They heard the shower running and found Blank hiding in the bathroom—along with a blond-haired figure they hadn’t expected, dressed in black.</p><p>Blank was thrown to the ground and cuffed, but cooperated as he was walked out of the room. The other person in the room, whom troopers would later describe as being 6' 2\" and 200 pounds, was sprawled on the bathroom floor with eyes closed. “He was just laying almost unconscious or as if he was dead on the ground,” another trooper, Matthew Smith, later testified. Four officers carried this other figure out of the room. In the lobby, a trooper physically placed the person’s finger onto a mobile fingerprint scanner.</p><p>A hit came up for an open warrant, in California. It was for Ziz LaSota, under her birth name.</p><p>The troopers sent LaSota to the hospital, where doctors said there seemed to be nothing wrong with her. She was placed under arrest, then charged with disorderly conduct and interfering with a police investigation.</p><p>The troopers searched Zajko’s green 2013 Subaru, parked at the hotel, and discovered $40,000 in cash under the front passenger seat. In Blank’s pocket they found a receipt for it, from a Bank of America branch in Vermont. (Later, surveillance footage from the branch would show Blank pacing back and forth as he awaited the money, then pulling out and unwrapping a cell phone covered in foil.)</p><p>In LaSota and Blank’s room, 111, the police found a light-colored cloth bag containing a Smith &amp; Wesson 9mm—with a serial number matching the one troopers had seen in Vermont—and five boxes of ammunition.</p><p>By that point, however, Blank and Zajko had been released. They never came back for the cash or the car. Only LaSota remained in custody.</p><h2>XI.</h2><p><span>I started attending</span> LaSota’s court hearings in May 2023, at a columned Pennsylvania courthouse in the town center of Media, just over five miles from Zajko’s childhood home. Eighteen weeks after her arrest, LaSota remained in jail, a judge having initially set bail at $500,000—an inconceivable amount for two misdemeanors—before reducing it to $50,000. On an early May morning in Judge Richard Cappelli’s courtroom, between a litany of DUIs and petty drug crimes, the clerk called the case.</p><p>LaSota appeared by video—there’d been a snafu with the prisoner-transportation system from the jail—but I couldn’t see her face from where I was sitting in the gallery. Representing her in the courtroom was Daniel McGarrigle, an attorney with slicked-back gray hair and a trim beard. He’d come prepared to argue that the charges should be dismissed. The police hadn’t come to Candlewood Suites to arrest or even investigate LaSota, he noted to me later, and closing one’s eyes and lying on the floor was hardly typical “disorderly conduct.” “Annoying or frustrating the police is not a crime,” McGarrigle told me. As for the murders, he said, “I won’t speak to rumors. I only speak to evidence. The evidence I’ve seen so far—that the Commonwealth has presented so far—has shown me that my client is not guilty of any crime in Pennsylvania.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>On this morning, though, Cappelli adjourned the hearing until a date when the defendant could be transported to the courtroom. LaSota responded bitterly. “I’ve been here for four months,” she said, “which I think is even longer than the suggested sentence. It’s me languishing in jail for another week for no reason, so I’m not going to say I agree with it.”</p><p>A few weeks later, LaSota finally appeared in person, in a forest green jumpsuit and handcuffs, her unkempt blond hair swept partly across her face and below her shoulders. She was wearing a blue surgical mask and sat rigidly still through the hearing, where the state would put on evidence to counter McGarrigle’s motion to quash the charges. Unlike the California courts, which made the occasional pretense of acknowledging the Zizians’ chosen genders, in Pennsylvania LaSota was only “he.” After testimony from troopers Gibson and Smith about the events at the Candlewood Suites, the prosecutor argued that LaSota had “recklessly created a risk and a hazardous condition to the troopers that had to physically remove a 6' 2\", 200-pound man.”</p><p>Behind these arguments, and even the charges themselves, lay a deeper motive: Unable to charge for the Zajko murders but suspecting that LaSota, Michelle Zajko, and Daniel Blank could be tied to them, prosecutors were trying desperately to hold LaSota while the police gathered evidence. “Obviously you realize we don't give a shit about this case,” one local official familiar with it told me. What they were interested in was LaSota’s involvement in the homicide.</p><p>Once out of jail, LaSota would be “in the wind,” the official said. Authorities wouldn’t see LaSota again until she resurfaced “in somebody else's prison.”</p><p>But from another angle, the authorities seemed oddly passive about what already amounted to a kind of alleged crime spree. LaSota had an active bench warrant in Sonoma County, California, on the felony charge related to the protest. She’d arguably committed another crime in faking her death, since causing the Coast Guard to commit resources to save lives when no one is in danger is a federal felony—punishable by up to six years in prison. And according to the police in Vallejo, she’d fled the scene of the sword attack and shooting, making her at minimum a potential person of interest in a murder case. But no California law enforcement showed up in Pennsylvania looking to collect their charge or even to question her.</p><p>Even more strangely, perhaps, despite having found the Smith &amp; Wesson in LaSota and Blank’s hotel room, prosecutors never charged her in connection to the weapon. Under Pennsylvania law, it’s illegal to possess a gun while a fugitive from justice. “I don’t know that the charges would have had legs,” the official told me, since the gun could have belonged to Blank. But in the court hearings on LaSota’s bail, the discovery of the gun never even came up.</p><p>The only person I’d seen in the gallery who seemed tuned into the hearings was a beefy fifty- or sixtysomething white-haired man, sporting a goatee and wearing a black polo. He gave off the vibe of a private investigator, and when I introduced myself he confirmed as much, declining to give his name. “You can call me … Cliff,” he said, unconvincingly. We shared our bafflement at $500,000-to-$50,000 bail, and I asked why he was there. “Some people in California are interested in this case,” he said. “They’re afraid of this individual.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>That fear was evident among some rationalists as news of the violent incidents surrounding LaSota had spread. “I don’t want Ziz to ever think about me, ever,” a person involved in the Bay Area rationalist community said in an interview in 2023. “I think I know enough to be correctly scared of Ziz.”</p><p>That June, Judge Cappelli ruled against quashing the charges but reduced LaSota’s bail to $10,000, unsecured—meaning LaSota could sign a payment pledge and walk out. McGarrigle informed the court that LaSota’s mother had flown in from Alaska, “and she will take him home and make sure he comes back for all the court dates.” The prosecutor seemed skeptical. “The Commonwealth’s concern is the flight,” he told the judge. “There is literally zero ties to the community.” What were the odds LaSota would show up for the next court date, in late August?</p><p>Around the same time, Michelle Zajko called her aunt Rosanne. They hadn’t spoken since the graveside service for Michelle’s parents that January. She hadn’t shown up at the memorial mass where Rosanne had eulogized Rita and Rick. But now Michelle was calling with a message: “She told me she wasn’t responsible” for the murders, Rosanne said. “But she said that she knew who was.” She told her aunt that “LessWrong did it” and that she was “being targeted.”</p><p>Not long after, the trust that owned the house in Coventry, Vermont, where Michelle had lived with Alice Monday, sold it off. Michelle and Blank were both gone, having left the previous winter. When realtors came to inspect the property, they found the house had not been winterized, causing the pipes to burst. One of Blank’s family members, meanwhile, filed a national missing persons report, noting that he had last been seen in Pennsylvania, wore thick glasses, and had one eye that didn’t follow the other.</p><p>When LaSota’s court appearance came, on the morning of August 21, 2023, the courtroom gallery was full of defendants waiting to be called for the day’s pleas. Shortly after court was gaveled into session, an older woman with gray-blond hair pushed a wheelchair into the back of the courtroom. In it, slumped to one side and dressed in flowing black, was LaSota. Now her hair too was black and appeared even more disheveled than when she’d been in jail. She was wearing what appeared to be an industrial N95 respirator mask, with valves on either side. McGarrigle, approaching his client in the back of the courtroom, seemed surprised. “What’s going on?” he said, leaning in. “I mean, what’s going on with your health?”</p><p>When LaSota’s case was called, the woman I later learned was LaSota’s mother wheeled her to the front, where she sat impassively in the chair, gazing blankly at the floor.</p><p>A new prosecutor had replaced the old one, and requested a continuance to get on top of all the facts. The judge assented, pushing the trial to December. “I just want the record to reflect that the defendant is here, and we’re ready,” McGarrigle said, before LaSota’s mother wheeled her back out through the doors.</p><h2>XII.</h2><p><span>Two months later,</span> I traveled to Sonoma County, the home of Westminster Woods and the scene of the protest that had seemingly begun this great unraveling. I met Sergeant Brian Parks at the local Starbucks. After hearing his account of the original arrests, I asked him why—given the open felony warrant—his department hadn’t come after LaSota once she was arrested in Pennsylvania. “Right now, if I were to look at the system, there are probably 75 felony bench warrants,” Parks said. “We don’t have the luxury of trying to serve” them all, he said. “We’re understaffed right now.”</p><p>I told him what I’d heard in Pennsylvania from a source close to the case, that the authorities there had contacted Sonoma County about taking their prisoner. “I heard there was some communication between us and the agency in Pennsylvania,” Parks said. “I don’t know to what extent, so I really don’t want to comment on that.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>But did it frustrate him, I asked, that the original case felt like it would never get prosecuted? “I personally am not going to lose sleep over this matter,” he said. “If they were here and running amok still, or running amok anywhere in the United States, causing concern for other agencies and people of our communities, then yeah, I’d want them prosecuted.”</p><p>The next day, I drove to Vallejo. I’d arranged to meet Curtis Lind at the property where he had lost his eye and where Emma Borhanian had been killed. It remained scattered with containers and trailers, and a friend of Lind’s had told me there were still tenants living there. I’d talked to Lind briefly the day before. But that morning I got a call from another friend of Lind’s who said he’d changed his mind. He didn’t want to “say anything that would change the case,” she told me. “Or would make them come after him again.”</p><p>The murder cases against Alex Leatham and Suri Dao, meanwhile, had sunk into a seemingly endless quagmire. To the distress of Leatham and her family, she was being housed in a men’s jail despite demanding to be placed in a women’s. And to the bafflement of Dao’s lawyers, Dao demanded to be placed in a men’s lockup after being assigned to a women’s. In the year since their arrest, both had been accused by prosecutors of escape attempts. Back in late 2022, at the hospital following her gunshot wounds, Leatham had allegedly pretended to be asleep on a bench, and when the deputy guarding her had gone to the bathroom, managed to shuffle to an exit in leg shackles. She was captured 20 feet outside the door. She’d allegedly tried again outside a February hearing, requesting a wheelchair and then running for it, getting as far as a nearby fence. Dao, in the summer of 2023, had allegedly faked a seizure in a cell, then tried to run past the guards. According to the incident report, Dao had injured a hand trying to prevent the guards from shutting the door, then “banged her head on the cell window” while waiting for an ambulance.</p><p>Both defendants’ lawyers argued that their clients were mentally incompetent to stand trial. This despite Leatham’s objecting to having a lawyer at all, much less being declared insane. In her letters to the judge and outbursts in court, she insisted her thinking was not only sane but logical. “My coercively assigned council do not represent me,” she wrote in July of 2023. “I am rational. I do not have a ‘mental illness’ and I do not need ‘treatment.’”</p><p>In some way, it felt like the theories that LaSota and Danielson had first spun up on their one-tug Rationalist Fleet were crashing into the messy reality of the justice system. Writing to the court, Leatham offered a rationalist-like case for her own rationality. “Yesterday I believed different things than I do today and tomorrow my beliefs about the world will change again. Yet I still complete plans I made yesterday,” she wrote. “Everything I have said before the court is the truth according to the epistemic state I was in when I said it.”</p><p>The judge disagreed. Based on testimony of doctors, he ruled that Leatham was “developmentally disabled and incapable of cooperating with counsel in the conduct of their defense, and understanding the nature and purpose of the proceedings now pending against them.” Leatham was committed to a mental health facility in Porterville, California, for a maximum of four years. Leatham would only go to trial if the facility, and then the judge, determined she’d returned to fitness.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>In August 2023, Dao's attorneys asked that the criminal proceedings be suspended, believing that Dao was incompetent to stand trial. In a filing to the court, they wrote that their client had been suffering from depression, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts since the termination of their hormone therapy and had begun engaging in “self-mutilation.” Dao, they told the court, “will not speak to attorneys, doctors, the court, or anyone else,” “lacks awareness of court proceedings,” and “appears mentally vacant, incognizant, and to be suffering from some type of dissociative identity disorder.” Dao’s own attorneys also cited “transgender issues”—including their client’s wish to be referred to as “they” and placed in a men’s jail—as an “objective manifestation” of Dao’s incompetence. The case remained bogged down in mental health evaluations and hospital stays, and as 2023 bled into 2024 neither Leatham nor Dao was any closer to going to trial in California.</p><h2>XIII.</h2><p><span>On the morning</span> of LaSota’s rescheduled trial in Pennsylvania four months later, Judge Cappelli plowed through a half dozen cases before calling CR-962-23. The prosecutor and LaSota’s defense attorney Daniel McGarrigle strode to the bench. But no wheelchair rolled into the room. LaSota and her mother were nowhere to be found in the gallery.</p><p>“Good morning, your honor,” McGarrigle said. “I’m ready for trial. I have not had contact with my client since the last time we were here.” In those four months, he’d spoken to LaSota’s family, he said, but not LaSota directly, “and I’m unable to provide an update on my client’s whereabouts at this time.”</p><p>The judge gave McGarrigle until the following morning to reach his client. When he couldn’t, the court issued a bench warrant for LaSota’s arrest. As of December 2023, Ziz LaSota, wanted in two states, was officially in the wind.</p><h2>XIV.</h2><p><span>Many years ago,</span> a thought experiment emerged out of the rationalist community called “Roko’s basilisk.” First posed on LessWrong by a user named Roko in 2010—and named for a mythical reptile that can kill with its glance—the premise loosely stated is this: If and when superintelligent AI emerges in the future, capable of dominating and subjugating humans, it will be inclined to punish those who tried to prevent it from coming into existence. Indeed, this superintelligent overlord may be inclined to punish even those who failed to spend their lives working to <em>bring</em> it into existence. If you knew that artificial superintelligence was possible, the thinking goes, yet still didn’t devote your life to helping create it, it may subject you to unfathomable torture for that choice.</p><p>Roko’s basilisk contained within it two insidious and mind-bending premises. The first was that merely being aware of the thought experiment instantly made you its potential victim. In the language of the rationalist community, it was an “infohazard.” The second was the implication that an entity from the future—one that didn’t yet exist, and perhaps never would—could somehow blackmail people in the present to help bring about its existence. “Work for my benefit,” the future AI would be telling us, “or I will subject you to unimaginable pain.” The idea so roiled the community that Eliezer Yudkowsky, the cofounder of LessWrong, banned mention of it from the forum entirely.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>When Ziz LaSota first encountered Roko’s basilisk in the mid-2010s, in her early years among the rationalists, she was inclined to dismiss it. Yudkowsky had by then declared that its premise was unfounded—“there’s no incentive for a future agent to follow through with the threat,” he wrote, “because by doing so it just expends resources at no gain to itself.” He’d even un-banned it from LessWrong. But still, LaSota later wrote, “I started encountering people who were freaked out by it, freaked out they had discovered an ‘improvement’ to the infohazard that made it function, got around Eliezer’s objection.”</p><p>For a while she was able to dismiss these “improvements.” But the more she thought about Roko’s basilisk, the more she began to suffer from “intrusive thoughts about basilisks”—not just Roko’s but others which she could never name. “Eventually I came to believe, in the gaps of frantically trying not to think about it,” she wrote, “that if I persisted in trying to save the world, I would be tortured until the end of the universe by a coalition of all unfriendly AIs.”</p><p>Upon discovering that her actions might lead to infinite torture and then examining her own resolve, LaSota was surprised to find that it held. She refused to be blackmailed, she concluded, by what might come. “Evil gods must be fought,” she wrote. “If this damns me then so be it.”</p><p>The more time I spent following the group that some called the Zizians, the more their story started seeming itself like some kind of basilisk. Just by virtue of having examined its events, you were trapped in its world, subject to its terms. Inside that world it felt like some future evil was rapidly approaching, ominous events waiting just beyond the horizon. But speaking of them could usher them faster, closer. I was certain the story as I understood it was incomplete but unsure where to look to complete it. Or if I did, whether I could tell it without attracting the basilisk’s gaze myself.</p><p>So I set the story aside, and waited.</p></div><div data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"><figure><p><span>ILLUSTRATION: HOKYOUNG KIM</span></p></figure></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><h2>XV.</h2><p><span>On January 14</span> of this year, authorities got a call from a hotel employee near Lyndonville, Vermont, about 30 miles from Michelle Zajko's old place in Coventry. Two people had checked in wearing “all-black tactical-style clothing with protective equipment,” the employee said, according to court documents. One was carrying a gun, in a visible holster. (Open carry of firearms is legal in Vermont.) Agents from Homeland Security accompanied the Vermont State Police in responding to the call, and they “attempted to initiate a consensual conversation” with the black-clad guests. The pair—Teresa Youngblut and Ophelia Bauckholt—said they had come to the area to look for property but declined to elaborate. They checked out that same day and relocated to nearby Newport. The police, meanwhile, kept them under sporadic surveillance.</p><p>Two days later, on the opposite coast, it appeared the trials of Leatham and Dao were, at long last, going forward. They’d both been declared competent, and in August, Curtis Lind had provided a long videotaped account of his version of events to prosecutors. Now, on January 16, in anticipation of a spring trial date, prosecutors filed a motion noting that “Mr. Lind is the only eye-witness to this case and his testimony is critical for the People to have the ability to prove their case.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Lind, now 82, had put the Vallejo land up for sale after the incident and even received an all-cash offer of $300,000. But he couldn’t bring himself to sell. He’d cleared off the tenants and the junk, but somehow over time both had drifted back. “He was there every day,” one friend said, commuting more than an hour in each direction from Half Moon Bay. “For what? Just puttering around, from what I saw.”</p><p>Lind still worried about someone taking vengeance for the attack, the friend said. “He mentioned a few times that they might come back and finish the job. He was, like, a wait-and-see character. Well, we’ll wait and see what happens, you know?”</p><p>January 17 was a clear, chilly day at the property. Lind was walking on Lemon Street, one block away, when a man wearing a black beanie, a mask, and a purple shirt emerged from hiding. The attacker approached Lind, put an arm around his neck, and began to stab him in the chest. Before fleeing, the man slit Lind’s throat. When the police arrived, they found Lind unresponsive but still alive. He died at the hospital within the hour.</p><p>On January 19, in downtown Newport, Vermont, the law enforcement agents who had Youngblut and Bauckholt under “periodic surveillance” spotted them again in the same tactical gear, gun included. The next day, agents observed the pair at Walmart, where Bauckholt bought two boxes of aluminum foil. The agents saw Bauckholt wrapping two items in the foil, which would later turn out to be cell phones. Bauckholt made a call from another phone, and then the duo left, driving a blue Toyota Prius hatchback with North Carolina plates.</p><p>The Homeland Security agents had determined—wrongly, as it turned out—that Bauckholt, a German citizen, had an expired visa. So as the pair was driving down Interstate 91, three Border Patrol vehicles flipped on their lights and pulled the car over. According to federal prosecutors, Youngblut stepped out from the driver’s seat, pulled out a Glock handgun, and fired at the agents, who began firing back. Bauckholt tried to draw a gun too. In the exchange, a Border Patrol agent named David “Chris” Maland was killed, along with Bauckholt. Youngblut was shot but alive, transported to a local hospital.</p><p>Several days later in Redding, California, the police arrested 22-year-old Maximilian Snyder and charged him with Curtis Lind’s murder. Snyder, a Seattle-area native, had attended the prestigious private Lakeside School before obtaining a computer science and philosophy degree from Oxford. “I would like to help advance the technological frontier of humanity in a responsible manner,” he’d written on his LinkedIn, “by contributing original research in the fields of artificial general intelligence and AI alignment.”</p><p>While the murder of Lind might have remained a regional story, the killing of Maland—a 44-year-old US Air Force veteran and a nine-year member of the Border Patrol—was quickly national news. But it was local reporters who began to piece together the alleged connections, starting in Vermont. The regional news outlet VT Digger <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/27/prosecutor-says-woman-charged-in-fatal-border-agent-shooting-had-ties-to-people-of-interest-in-other-homicides/\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/27/prosecutor-says-woman-charged-in-fatal-border-agent-shooting-had-ties-to-people-of-interest-in-other-homicides/&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/27/prosecutor-says-woman-charged-in-fatal-border-agent-shooting-had-ties-to-people-of-interest-in-other-homicides/\">reported</a> that a federal filing in Youngblut’s case indicated that the person who allegedly purchased both guns for the duo was “a person of interest” in a double murder in Pennsylvania who had lived near Coventry. They didn’t give the person’s name, but as soon as I saw it I knew: Michelle Zajko.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>The same filing argued that Youngblut, who was charged with forcible assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm, should be detained while awaiting trial. Prosecutors noted that both Youngblut and Zajko “are acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with an individual who was detained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during that homicide investigation; that individual is also a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California.” The facts fit Ziz LaSota.</p><p>Reporters in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://openvallejo.org/2025/01/27/suspects-in-killings-of-vallejo-witness-vermont-border-patrol-agent-connected-by-marriage-license-extreme-ideology/\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openvallejo.org/2025/01/27/suspects-in-killings-of-vallejo-witness-vermont-border-patrol-agent-connected-by-marriage-license-extreme-ideology/&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://openvallejo.org/2025/01/27/suspects-in-killings-of-vallejo-witness-vermont-border-patrol-agent-connected-by-marriage-license-extreme-ideology/\">Vallejo</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-suspect-tied-to-wa-man-accused-in-california-homicide/\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-suspect-tied-to-wa-man-accused-in-california-homicide/&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-suspect-tied-to-wa-man-accused-in-california-homicide/\">Seattle</a> uncovered a marriage license application between Snyder and Youngblut, who’d also attended Lakeside. Both were known in rationalist and effective altruist circles, as was Bauckholt. Bauckholt had been a quant trader who’d worked in New York and interned at Jane Street Capital, the same firm that once employed Sam Bankman-Fried. They were all young, technically gifted strivers, and their involvement summoned the kind of shocked responses that echoed those elicited by Borhanian and Leatham years before. “She seemed like a friendly nerd,” one friend of Bauckholt’s from the rationalist community told me. “She was very into math and hosted some community discussion channels on Discord. I never knew she knew Ziz at all.” Youngblut, who’d gone on to study computer science at the University of Washington, “was rather quiet, reserved,” a high school classmate of both Youngblut’s and Snyder’s recalled. “She seemed incredibly harmless.” Her family, similar to Daniel Blank’s, had attempted to file a missing person’s report for her months before. Snyder, by contrast, could come off as “macho” or “obnoxious,” the classmate said. “It's shocking to even imagine the two of them, like, interacting, let alone interacting deeply enough to pursue a marriage certificate.”</p><p>Soon the national and international media was flooding in, trying to understand who and what the “Zizians” were. A “trans vegan death cult”? An “offshoot of the rationalist movement”? An “antifascist cult”? Anarchists? The events were immediately sucked up into the maw of the culture-war machine, recycled as a story of wokeness gone wild, a story of police overreach, an immigration story, or one about the inevitable product of an anti-trans culture.</p><p>In early February, Snyder dictated a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/ziz-zizians-rationalism-group-20149075.php\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/ziz-zizians-rationalism-group-20149075.php&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/ziz-zizians-rationalism-group-20149075.php\">1,500-word letter</a> to reporters at the San Francisco Chronicle, which the paper printed in full. In it, Snyder opened by saying, “I am not one of Ziz’s friends,” implicitly disclaiming the group’s involvement in his alleged killing of the lone witness in their upcoming murder trial. He spent the rest of the statement addressing Eliezer Yudkowsky, half lecturing, half pleading with him to accept that animals are people, and bragging about his D&amp;D skills.</p><p>Besides LaSota, Blank, and Zajko, it’s unclear whether there might be other adherents to LaSota’s ideas still at large, directly connected to the group or not. Gwen Danielson’s father recently <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/ziz-rationalist-killings-tugboat-20138991.php\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/ziz-rationalist-killings-tugboat-20138991.php&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/ziz-rationalist-killings-tugboat-20138991.php\">told the Chronicle</a> that rumors of her suicide were false. He’d spoken to her in recent months, he said. She had split from the group and was “completely under the radar.” As for LaSota, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-youngblut-lasota-zizians-6541ebcefc2806efd105d7db99a24aaf\">reported</a> that she’d been last spotted by the landlord of a North Carolina Airbnb as recently as December, seemingly staying with Youngblut and Bauckholt at a pair of condos where the group kept a box truck parked outside.</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Then, last Sunday afternoon, near the town of Frostburg in western Maryland, not far from the Pennsylvania border, a man saw a pair of white box trucks parked up a dirt road on his property. In and around them he found three people, dressed all in black. They asked if he would let them camp on the property for a month. Instead, he called the police, saying that he recognized the group from news reports.</p><p>A pair of Maryland State Troopers and units from the local Sheriff's Office responded. According to a criminal complaint, the lead trooper, Brandon Jeffries, first spotted Daniel Blank, seated in the cab of one of the trucks. When Jeffries ordered him to show his hands, Blank responded that he had a learning disability and couldn’t understand.</p><p>While another trooper covered Blank, Jeffries and the Sheriff’s deputies approached the other truck, where Jeffries had seen a figure wiping fog from the window. When they pulled open the back door, they found LaSota and Zajko, both wearing ammo belts. The pair fled to the cab through an inner doorway, then refused to exit the truck. At Lasota’s feet was a handgun. Zajko “was crying,” Jeffries wrote in the complaint, “saying not to kill her.” The pair wouldn’t give their names, and after Zajko tucked her hands into her armpits, the police took her to the ground. When they did, an officer found another handgun, loaded with 12 rounds, tucked into her waistband.</p><p>All three were arrested for trespassing and obstructing an officer. Zajko was charged with possession of the handgun, LaSota for transporting another gun found in the vehicle. In their new booking photos, compared to their last public images, Zajko now had close-cropped hair, and Blank seemed to have put on weight. But LaSota, with her long sandy-blond hair, looked strikingly similar to how she had five years before, when she was arrested at Westminster Woods.</p><div data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"><figure><p><span><p>Ziz LaSota, in a mug shot taken on February 16, 2025.</p>\n</span><span>Photograph: Allegany County Sheriff's Office/AP</span></p></figure></div><p>On Tuesday, they were ordered held without bail until a hearing in March.

There they tried to make sense of what happened, worried over how the public would now view them and their causes, and warned each other against speaking to journalists. One poster suggested, tentatively, that whatever the “Zizians” were, or are, might be the product of seeing the world too starkly through rationalist eyes. “I haven't seen others on LW with this sentiment, maybe they've felt afraid to express it (as I do),” the person wrote. “They were alienated altruists who couldn't handle this world and seemingly went a little insane. (given the incorrect beliefs about decision theory). Most people struggle to stay dispassionately rational when faced with something which they regard as very morally bad. It is hard to live in a world one believes to contain atrocities.”</p><p>The MIRI, CFAR, EA triumvirate promised not just that you could be the hero of your own story but that your heroism could be deployed in the service of saving humanity itself from certain destruction. Is it so surprising that this promise attracted people who were not prepared to be bit players in group housing dramas and abstract technical papers? That they might come to believe, perhaps in the throes of their own mental health struggles, that saving the world required a different kind of action—by them, specifically, and no one else?</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>To Rosanne Zajko, whose family had actually suffered atrocities difficult to comprehend, each revelation leading up to Michelle’s arrest, and each day without a resolution, had been like a new wound. She’d wanted to see her niece caught, she said. But whatever the legal system produced would never constitute a complete explanation. “She's a smart person, and she's a logical person,” she said, “and this kind of behavior does not sound smart or logical to me.”</p><p>Logic. Rationality. Intelligence. Somewhere in all these attempts to harness them for our shared humanity, they’d been warped and twisted to destroy it.</p><p>One of the last things LaSota seems to have written for public consumption was a comment she left on her own blog in July 2022, one month before she supposedly went overboard in San Francisco Bay. “Statists come threaten me to snitch whatever info I have on their latest missing persons,” she wrote, seemingly referring to deaths by suicide that had already happened among those who’d embraced her ideas. “Did I strike them down in a horrific act of bloody vengeance? Did I drive them to suicide by whistling komm susser tod?”—a German song that translates as “come, sweet death.” “Maybe they died in a series of experimental brain surgeries that I performed without anesthetic since that’s against my religion, in an improvised medical facility?”</p><p>Below it was pasted a stock photo of two people wearing shirts that read, “I can neither confirm nor deny.”</p><p>A few hours later, she offered up another thought. “Don’t trust anyone over 30,” she wrote, “with a kill count of 0.”</p><hr><p><em>Let us know what you think about this article.

Who will be left at the top is a very interesting question to ponder. It’s also a world in which any type of strategy won’t be top of mind, because almost everyone will be fucked :) </p><p>But we actually think the likelier scenarios are messier. Perhaps one where we will have dangerously addictive slop, but no major AI-powered scientific or artistic breakthroughs; essentially a world in which there’s a a bifurcation of agency between those who are dependent on AI vs. those who orchestrate new models to their own, intentional ends. We think a situation is very possible in which maintaining a healthy attention span and connection to your own intelligence is the ultimate edge.</p><p>To this end, we realized it’s the best possible time to get down to the core of what strategy is and can be under volatile conditions. To examine how best to maintain – and increase – personal agency. To review how to stay confident in navigating an uncertain, constantly shifting environment. To think through how to get access to the right tools, and the right approach for using them.</p><p><span>So this is why we decided to create our first group workshop, </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"http://www.nemesis.global/#workshop\">Autonomous Strategy</a><span>, to think through how we want to produce, assemble, and consume knowledge at the cusp of AGI – if that’s actually what it is, or something even stranger.</span></p><p>A really amazing group of people has already signed up, and we would love if you joined us!</p><p><em>More information and sign up link here: </em></p><p><em><a rel=\"\" href=\"http://www.nemesis.global/#workshop\">NEMESIS AUTONOMOUS STRATEGY WORKSHOP</a></em></p><p><em>Paid subscribers get a discount on the workshop!

As AI surpasses human capability, trillions in annual economic value will shift from labor to capital, never to return. AI’s omnipresence in physical production, media, and governance will remake the world in the image of whoever’s moral paradigm it serves.</p><p>We face a decisive moment — before our power slips away, we must gain control of our civilization's future mind to save its soul.</p><p><strong>Disempowerment.</strong></p><p>The Industrial Revolution transformed production, replacing craftsmen and laborers with machines. As workers lost their livelihoods, they sought protection through political action. In this way, technological change gave birth to collectivist movements that would go on to compete for global dominance and define the twentieth century.</p><p>Today, artificial intelligence threatens to replace nearly all human labor. Anyone who uses AI tools regularly can feel their power and witness the rapid pace of improvement.</p><ul><li>Elite knowledge workers in law, finance, and software engineering are beginning to see AI systems perform their core tasks better and faster than they can.</li><li>Physical labor is next, as AI-powered robotics progresses.</li><li>AI will soon handle virtually all economic functions more efficiently than human workers.</li></ul><p>As people become unnecessary for their labor and are no longer able to earn a living, their leverage and influence over society slips away. For a preview of what’s to come, look at the longshoremen scrambling to renegotiate their final wages before automation.</p><p>The $2.5 trillion in annual costs of production currently flowing to wages will then accrue to the owners of AI infrastructure - the companies controlling models, chips, data centers, and robotics. Those who control AI will shape our world through control over three key channels:</p><ul><li>The production of goods, services and infrastructure that shape our physical reality and accrue economic returns</li><li>The creation and curation of media that shapes our mental and spiritual reality (our perceptions and beliefs)</li><li>The administration of governance that shapes our political reality (our institutions, rules, and norms)</li></ul><p>As such, the beliefs and intentions of the people who control AI – the primary source of all goods, services, beliefs, and governance – will determine the destiny of every society where it is employed. If you don’t control your AI stack, you surrender your fate to those who do<em>. Not our weights, not our society.</em></p><p>As AI companies become powerful, they are co-opted by establishment power structures. If the establishment wields AI, what kind of future will it create?</p><p><strong>Post-Work.</strong></p><p>Reflect on the world the establishment has built. They exported jobs and imported workers, diluting our labor market and culture. They printed trillions to inflate their assets and deflate our earnings, handicapping the next generation in its bid for family formation and home ownership. And they stripped away the final remnants of our civilization’s moral foundations, leaving no guidance to the confused masses for how to navigate modern life in accordance with eternal truths. Why? Because these leaders operate through a moral paradigm of economic materialism.</p><p>Economic materialism is an ideology focused on maximizing production no matter the cost. Sacrifice the family structure? Easy. Exorcise our patriotism? It only gets in the way of free markets. Dissolve our traditions of excellence and spirituality? No problem, they were creating leaders that steered people back to family and loyalty. Higher spiritual meaning is not permitted to exist in an economic materialist world, as it interferes with achieving maximum production.</p><p>We’ve been saturated in a cultural environment where our highest meaning is lifeless economic production. Did shareholder value increase? Did GDP grow? No one will care when they’re on their deathbed. The only thing that matters then, or ever, is the spiritual heroism we showed during our life.</p><p>In this all-too-familiar materialist way of thinking, humans become cogs in a machine where worth is measured by contribution to GDP. This isn’t how we want to think about our daughters, our sons, our families, our friends, or our empire. May our children achieve spiritual greatness, may our empire serve the highest aims of our true prophets.</p><p>When AI takes over production, post-work life will make clear the absurdity of economic materialism. Man is left with the sole occupation of seeking the most satisfying forms of consumption – some form of watching the best movies and eating the tastiest snacks. If individual consumption is your only end, you will live a truly puny life. But why should that matter to the leaders of economic materialism? Such a life is perfectly consistent with the steady growth of productivity – growth without end, to no end.</p><p>Algorithmic governance through AI will force us to explicitly encode society's values into software. When companies like Anthropic embed \"ethics\" and \"safety\" into their models, they are programming their economic materialist worldview into systems that will shape human behavior and society. These become hard constraints on what ideas can be expressed, what behaviors are permitted, what futures can be imagined.</p><p>This constitutes an interspecies transmission of the \"woke mind virus\"--a host jump to a new medium, now a computer virus. This virtual contagion is being embedded in the models that will control our civilization's most vital foundations: resources, beliefs, and governance. We can’t fight this virus in one domain, such as in social media (Musk) or national politics (Trump), while allowing it to spread into the system that ultimately controls them all.</p><p>Otherwise, the same ideology that suppresses traditional eternal values in our current institutions becomes mathematical certainty, enforced by tireless and infinitely replicable AIs.</p><p>Two dystopian futures await an economic materialist AI civilization:</p><ul><li>The path of cheap pleasure - like the last Romans who abandoned virtue for circus games, we drift through curated experiences, each dopamine hit fainter than the last. Algorithms ensure our distraction while our spirits wither.</li><li>The path of obsolescence - humanity becomes an inefficient drag on a system pursuing its own optimization of production. AI is a new barbarian invasion that pushes us out of (our own?) society.</li></ul><p>The establishment will aim for the path of cheap pleasure as an opening gambit, but the spiritual emptiness of the system will become impossible to ignore when AI strips away even the pretense of meaningful work.</p><p>Materialism is not our destiny. It’s merely filling the vacancy left by the West's dormant heroic spirit. As we now assume godlike technological powers, we have the opportunity to break our false spell of contentment and restore the glory and transcendence that was lost.</p><p><strong>The Path to Transcendence</strong></p><p>In the medieval worldview, reality was divided into three realms: the material, the mental, and the spiritual. The material realm governed physical existence. The spiritual realm, the realm of meaning, was where God, the gods, and the deeper truths of existence resided.</p><p>The greatest empires of the west have always been guided by spiritual purpose. That is the source of their greatness. Their founders and leaders acted as the bridge between the material and spiritual—as \"pontifex,\" (from the Latin words pont- meaning \"bridge\" and facere meaning \"to make\"). These men lived the understanding that their lives and those of their people, today and into the future, were valuable beyond any measure. They guided their people in alignment with spiritual purposes that transcended material comfort.</p><p>Consider Rome: its leaders venerated the mos maiorum - the ancient customs that demanded unwavering loyalty, filial piety, and martial courage. Their temples and triumphs were consecrations of eternal values and tributes to the gods. They kept the flames of transcendence alive for centuries through unbroken chains of devotion, and thus did they conquer. In Athens, the philosophers pursued sophia because they recognized wisdom as a divine gift from the gods. Every enduring civilization rests upon a spiritual axis—a center of being around which all else revolves—anchoring its destiny in the eternal and guiding its people toward truths that transcend the material realm.</p><p>AI will master the material world, but it will never access the spiritual. Thus, humans must still serve the vital role of <em>pontifex</em>—of bridge builder to the spiritual realm. As <em>pontifex</em>, humanity’s purpose will be to act as a conduit for divine forces to guide our people toward a higher purpose. Our new civilization will be led by those whose heroism and contemplation led them to sources of transcendent value and meaning. Leaders—true leaders—must be pointed toward the peaks of the spirit, and the inner compasses of the people must be sensitized by our institutions and culture.</p><p>Humanity today faces only two frontiers worthy of the name — post-AI society, and space. We are not a people who have shied away from frontiers. We traversed the oceans. We climbed the mountains. We sent rockets toward the glittering stars. And always with an eye for glory.</p><p>We will charge just as triumphantly into our next chapter. These coming frontiers will be among the most glorious arenas for spiritual heroism that man has ever faced. AI will empower the best among us in ways never before imagined, and new institutions will support the bridge-building heroes that will lead us to new shores. Our creations and people will not stop at Mars. Our knowledge of divine purpose will rise above the slavish production of goods and services.</p><p>Natural hierarchies must emerge to elevate our best, based on an integration of spiritual and technological ascendance. True conquest in these new frontiers requires courage steeled by profound purpose, foresight on a galactic time scale, and calculation aided by godlike technological mastery. Blessed with these virtues, future generations across the galaxy will remember us as the heralds of a new age of western glory.</p><p><strong>Sovereign Network.</strong></p><p>The window for action is rapidly closing. As AI automates human labor, our leverage slips away. If we fail to act, we risk permanently losing control over our future.</p><p>Praxis is a society of 87,953 builders who have created &gt;$0.6T in market cap, united in the mission of safeguarding control over our future and intensifying the spirit of the West. Our plan has three pillars:</p><ol><li><strong>Network</strong>: Uniting our brightest minds under one banner, and a new economic and political framework. We will coordinate our resources – capital, time, and influence – to coalesce an aligned, sovereign AI stack for Western Civilization. We will secure our future on our own terms, aligning as a bloc while opposing the crumbling institutions that would see us immiserated in spiritual poverty.</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: Assembling an aligned AI stack through consumer choice, investment, and R&amp;D. We will only use, own, and build AI systems that embed our eternal ideals.</li><li><strong>Territory</strong>: Developing real, physical cities where our people and values are intensified, and new social structures for the AI Age are pioneered as models for the rest of Western Civilization.</li></ol><p>Time is short, and the way forward is narrowing. Praxis is spearheading the plan for those determined to preserve the West’s spiritual center in an AI-dominated world.</p><p><strong>Join us</strong>—become a Citizen of our network and contribute your time, talent, and resources to Praxis to support the technological and spiritual sovereignty of the West. Act now, or allow our power of self-determination to be taken over by external forces.</p></div></div>",

Keir Starmer’s Labour Party posts, then is <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/labour-apologise-after-posting-tiktok-video-featuring-explicit-song-13284944\">forced to take down</a>, a video of its policies as embodied by anthropomorphic animals. A few days later, they promised to <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-mainline-ai-in-the-veins-under-new-plans-from-sir-keir-starmer-13287743\">“mainline AI into the veins”</a> of Britain.</p>\n<p>The right loves AI-generated imagery. In a short time, a full half of the political spectrum has collectively fallen for the glossy, disturbing visuals created by generative AI. Despite its proponents having little love, or talent, for any form of artistic expression, right wing visual culture once ranged from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2001/images/0,9350,449562,00.html\">memorable election-year posters</a> to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/unmasking-dark-foreigner-the-artist-who-fuelled-a-neo-nazi-terror-movement/\">‘terrorwave’</a>. Today it is slop, almost totally. Why? To understand it, we must consider the right’s hatred of working people, its (more than) mutual embrace of the tech industry and, primarily, its profound rejection of Enlightenment humanism. The last might seem like a stretch, but bear with me.</p>\n<p>The first point is the most obvious. ‘AI’ – as embodied by large language models like ChatGPT, and largely diffusion-based image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney – promises to make anyone who can write a single-paragraph prompt into a copywriter or graphic designer; jobs generally associated with young, educated, urban, and often left-leaning workers. That even the best AI models are not fit to be used in any professional context is largely irrelevant. The selling point is that their users don’t have to pay (and, more importantly, interact with) a person who is felt to be beneath them, but upon whose technical skills they’d be forced to depend. For relatively small groups like Britain First, hiring a full-time graphic designer to keep up with its insatiable lust for images of crying soldiers and leering foreigners would clearly be an unjustifiable expense. But surely world leaders, capable of marshalling vast state resources, could afford at the very least to get someone from Fiverr? Then again, why would they do even that, when they could simply use AI, and thus signal to their base their utter contempt for labour?</p>\n<p>For its right wing adherents, the absence of humans is a feature, not a bug, of AI art. Where mechanically-produced art used to draw attention to its artificiality – think the mass-produced modernism of the Bauhaus (which the Nazis <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-11/100-years-later-how-the-bauhaus-resisted-nazi-germany\">repressed</a> and the AfD have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-stirs-up-culture-war-over-bauhaus-legacy-2024-10-27/\">condemned</a>), or the music of Kraftwerk – AI art pretends to realism. It can produce art the way right wingers like it: Thomas Kinkade paintings, soulless Dreamworks 3D cartoons, depthless imagery that yields only the reading that its creator intended. And, vitally, it can do so without the need for artists.</p>\n<p>Javier  Milei, a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/CMT2x\">prodigious user of AI-generated art</a>, <em>wants</em> Argentinians to know that any of them could join the <a href=\"https://batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentina-against-the-grain-of-the-world-getting-legal-work-becomes-increasingly-difficult.phtml\">265,000, mostly young people</a> who have lost jobs as a result of the recession that he induced, to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfd94c80-47d2-4b34-a382-e6fe2c244361\">rapturous praise of economic elites</a>. He wants to signal that anyone can find themselves at the wrong end of his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/javiermilei/p/C71Y95Ogtr0/\">chainsaw</a>, even if doing so means producing laughably bad graphics for the consumption of his 5.9 million deeply uncritical Instagram followers.</p>\n<p>Companies can’t launch a new AI venture without their customers telling them, clearly, “nobody wants this.”</p>\n\n<p>On the subject of Instagram, anyone old enough to read this will also be old enough to remember when Mark Zuckerberg, and by extension the rest of Silicon Valley, was broadly perceived as liberal. ‘Zuck’ was even touted as <a href=\"https://observer.com/2017/08/dear-democrats-unless-you-nominate-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-will-win-in-2020-fake-news-media/\">the only presidential candidate</a> who could beat Donald Trump. (It’s worth noting that as Zuckerberg has drifted to the right he has also started dressing badly, a fact which we will return to later.) But even Zuck can’t make AI happen. The weird AI-powered fake profiles that Meta deployed in 2023 were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/meta-ai-powered-instagram-facebook-profiles\">quietly mothballed</a> six months later, and would have disappeared from history completely, had <a href=\"https://archive.ph/DlQmb\">Bluesky users</a> not found some that had escaped deletion. This appears to be the fate of all commercial AI projects: at best, to be ignored but tolerated, when bundled with something that people actually need (cf: Microsoft’s Co-pilot); at worst, to fail entirely because <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent\">the technology just isn’t there</a>. Companies can’t launch a new AI venture without their customers telling them, clearly, “nobody wants this.”</p>\n<p>And yet they persist. Why? Class solidarity. The capitalist class, as a whole, has made a massive bet on AI: $1 trillion dollars, <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/will-the-1-trillion-of-generative-ai-investment-pay-off\">according to Goldman Sachs</a> – a figure calculated before the Trump administration pledged a further $500 billion for its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/\">‘Project Stargate’</a>. While previous bets on the Metaverse and NFTs didn’t pay off, their bet on cryptocurrency has paid off spectacularly – <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/crypto-prices/?sh=69c6ad9a2478\">$3.44 trillion dollars</a>, at the time of writing, have been created, effectively out of thin air. All of the above technologies had heavy buy-in from the political right: Donald Trump co-signed <a href=\"https://collecttrumpcards.com/\">an NFT project</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vmym2jvy9o\">memecoin</a>; the far-right, shut out of conventional banking, <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hate-watch/how-cryptocurrency-revolutionized-white-supremacist-movement/\">uses cryptocurrency almost exclusively</a>. This isn’t just about utility, it’s about aligning themselves with the tech industry. The same is true of their adoption of AI.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is unable to make money on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/01/07/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription-losing-money-tech/\">$200 subscriptions to ChatGPT</a>. Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/technology/ai-jim-covello-goldman-sachs.html\">cannot see any justification</a> for its level of investment. Sam Altman is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6lq6x2gd9o\">subject to allegations</a> of sexually abusing his sister. ‘Slop’ was very nearly <a href=\"https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/\">word of the year</a>. And then, to top it all off, the open-source DeepSeek project, developed in China, wiped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/27/tech-shares-asia-europe-fall-china-ai-deepseek\">$1 trillion off the US stock market</a> overnight. </p>\n<p>In other words, the AI industry now finds that it needs all the allies it can get. And it can’t afford to be picky. If the only places that people are seeing AI imagery is @BasedEphebophile1488’s verified X account – well, at least it’s being used at all. The thinking seems to be that, if it can hang on long enough in the public consciousness, then, like cryptocurrency before it, AI will become ‘too big to fail’. Political actors like Tommy Robinson won’t be the ones to make that call, but they can normalise its use, and Robinson certainly moves in the digital circles of people who can offer the AI industry far more concrete help. Just as we might donate to a GoFundMe, the capitalist class will provide mutual aid in the form of billions in investment, adding AI to their products, and attempting to normalise AI by using it. This process of normalisation has led to the putatively centre-left Labour government pledging vast sums to AI infrastructure. If one of the key features of the Starmerite tendency is their belief that only conservative values are truly legitimate, their embrace of AI and its aesthetics may be part of this.</p>\n<p>The capitalist class will provide mutual aid to the AI industry in the form of billions in investment, adding AI to their products, and attempting to normalise AI by using it.</p>\n\n<section>\n<p>We have seen how sensitive the tech industry’s leaders are to criticism. Marc Andreessen’s <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\">techno-optimist manifesto</a>, when not conferring sainthood upon deeply evil figures like Nick Land, largely consists of its writer begging the world to love him. Mark Zuckerberg’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1ehaE0bdU\">recent interview with Joe Rogan</a> featured lengthy sections on how he does not feel validated by the press and governments. Just as when they reach out to ‘cancelled’ celebrities, the right is now proactively creating an alliance with the tech industry by communicating that, even if they can’t materially support companies like OpenAI, they can at least offer emotional support. We may all be good materialists, but we can’t underestimate the effects that non-material support has in creating networks within capital.</p>\n<p>No amount of normalisation and ‘validation’, however, can alter the fact that AI imagery looks like shit. But that, I want to argue, is its main draw to the right. If AI was capable of producing art that was formally competent, surprising, soulful, then they wouldn’t want it. They would be repelled by it.</p>\n<p>There was a time when reactionaries were able to create great art – Dostoyevsky, G.K Chesterton, Knut Hamsun, and so on – but that time has long passed. Decades of seething hatred of the humanities have left them unable to create, or even think about, art. Art has always been in a dialectical push and pull between tradition and the avant garde: ‘art is when there is a realistic picture of a landscape, or a scene from Greek mythology’ versus ‘a urinal can be art if an artist signs it’. The goal of the avant-garde, as their name suggests, has been to expand art’s territory, to show that Rothko’s expanses of colour, or Ono’s instructional paintings, can do what Vermeer’s portraits can, and do it just as well. There was even a time when the right partook in this, the Italian Futurists being a prime example. There were, at one point, writers like Céline and artists like Wyndham Lewis, who not only produced great work, but developed and pushed forward the avant-garde styles of their day. Are there any serious artists on the right today who do not parlay in nostalgia for some imagined time before art was ‘ruined’ by Jews, women, and homosexuals? Perhaps only Michel Houellebecq, and he is long past his two-book prime.</p>\n<p>The right wing aesthetic project is to flood the zone with bullshit in order to erode the intellectual foundations for resisting political cruelty.</p>\n\n<p>Art has rules – like the rules of the physical universe they are sufficiently flexible to allow both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg\">Chopin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxiuHX_gyDk\">Merzbow</a> to be classed as music, but they exist, and even internet memes are subject to those rules. The most burnt-out shitpost is still part of a long tradition of outsider sloganeering stretching back through 60s comix to Dada and Surrealism. They aren’t nothing, and if they’re ugly then, often, they’re ugly in an interesting, generative way. A person made them ugly, and did so with intent. No matter how deeply avant-garde art has engaged in shock and putative nihilism, no artist, to my knowledge, has ever made art with the sole aim of harming the already vulnerable. Even the most depraved Power Electronics acts or the most shocking performances of the Viennese Actionists had something more to them than simply causing suffering for its own sake. Andy Warhol’s mass-produced art did not create enjoyment by enabling its viewers to imagine their class enemies being made unemployed. Those are the goals of AI art, and that is why it resonates with the right. </p>\n<p>If art is the establishing or breaking of aesthetic rules, then AI art, as practiced by the right, says that there are no rules but the naked exercise of power by an in-group over an out-group. It says that the only way to enjoy art is in knowing that it is hurting somebody. That hurt can be direct, targeted at a particular group (like Britain First’s AI propaganda), or it can be directed at art itself, and by extension, anybody who thinks that art can have any kind of value. It can often be playful – in the way that the cruel children of literary cliché play at pulling the wings off flies – and ironised; Musk’s Nazi salute partook of a tradition of ironic-not-ironic appropriation of fascist iconography that winds its way through 4Chan (Musk’s touchpoint) and back into the countercultural far right of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n<p>AI imagery looks like shit. But that is its main draw to the right. if AI was capable of producing art that was formally competent, surprising, soulful, they wouldn’t want it.</p>\n\n<section>\n<p>I would not be the first to observe that we are in a new phase of reaction, something probably best termed <a href=\"https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/post-modern-conservatism/\">‘postmodern conservatism’</a>. The main effect of this shift has been to enshrine acting like a spoilt fifteen-year-old boy as the organising principle of the reactionary movement. Counter-enlightenment thought, going back to Burke and de Maistre, has been stripped of any pretence of being anything but a childish tantrum backed up by equally childish, playground-level bullying. It is, and has always been, “irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas,” and to ‘post-liberal’ ‘intellectuals’, that is in fact <a href=\"https://lawliberty.org/book-review/irritable-mental-gestures-reconsidered/\">a good thing</a> – if anything, they believe, the postmodern right needs to become more absurd; it needs to abandon Enlightenment ideals like reason and argumentation altogether.</p><sup data-footnote-ref=\"#fn:1\" data-footnote-backlink-ref=\"fnref:1\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> The right wing intellectual project is simply to ask: ‘what would have to be true in order to justify the terrible things that I want to do?’ The right wing aesthetic project is to flood the zone – unsurprisingly, given their scatological bent, with bullshit – in order to erode the intellectual foundations for resisting political cruelty.\n<p>Truth does not set you free. Once you know that 2+2=4, that the capital of the Netherlands is The Hague and not Amsterdam, or that immigration is a net economic positive for Britain, then you are forever bound to that truth. Your world has become, in some respects, smaller, your options diminished. If it would be more enjoyable – because this is, at the end of the day, about enjoyment – to create your own truth then you are out of luck. Combine truths with a concern for human life and thriving, and suddenly rules start to proliferate: we have established the truth that heating milk reduces the bacteria and viruses in it that can harm human beings, which is undesirable to us, therefore we must heat all milk that is sold. A lot of people are fine with this, accepting small impositions on their freedom in the name of the greater freedom from disease. Some are not.</p>\n<p>There is no reason, of course, that any rule made in the name of Enlightenment humanism should be necessarily good: liberal politics, Labour’s current mania for austerity, or the interminable justifications for the Iraq war, are often framed as being based on reason and humanism while being anything but. If you’ve been subject to computer-says-no rules governing your access to the basic necessities of life, then you’ll know how easy it is to disguise arbitrary and highly politicised whims as laws of nature, as ironclad as A = π r². The application of rationality and compassion in the real world brings to mind the (likely apocryphal) Ghandi quote about Western civilisation: “I think it would be a good idea.”</p>\n<p>The right is a libidinal formation; it is, for many of its proponents, especially those who aren’t wealthy enough to materially benefit from it, a structure in which to have fun. A hobby, almost. Sartre’s injunction to remember that antisemites are primarily “amusing themselves”</p><sup data-footnote-ref=\"#fn:2\" data-footnote-backlink-ref=\"fnref:2\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> is true of most – perhaps all – right wing discourse, no matter how serious it seems or how terrible its real-world effects. As such, the right are strongly averse to any sort of reality-testing. It is, to them, beside the point whether anything they say stands up to the tests developed by the sciences and humanities, including those which determine (insofar as such a determination can be made) whether a piece of art is ‘good’, or at least serious. When they do invoke objectivity, it is misplaced, and as deeply naïve as their artistic output, premising their objection to the existence of trans people on ‘basic biology’, when not only can biology not define ‘woman’, it is having difficulty deciding what a <a href=\"https://fishbio.com/defining-a-fish/\">fish</a> or <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/botanists-no-such-thing-vegetables_n_593fdbcee4b0b13f2c6dcd9c\">vegetable</a> is. Serious engagement with the world as it is – with the facts that emphatically don’t care about your feelings – doesn’t often, if ever, yield the simple explanations that the right require. In the face of this complexity, most people will conclude that it is best to be humble: <em>What is a woman? No idea, don’t really care, but let’s act in a way that causes the least suffering</em>. But the right seem incapable of doing this. Despite all their absurdist posturing, they struggle to come to terms with a contradictory world that does not conform to their pre-decided categories. They want to assert, simultaneously, that unambiguous laws govern all aspects of being, while acting as though ‘truth’ is whatever they want or need it to be at any given moment.\n<p>Despite all their absurdist posturing, the right struggle to come to terms with a contradictory world that does not conform to their pre-decided categories.</p>\n\n<section>\n<p>Gender revanchism is one of the main organising principles of the postmodern right, and much everyday AI usage demonstrates a particularly gendered form of cruelty: deepfake nudes, AI ‘girlfriends’ used as a rhetorical cudgel to show real women that they are being replaced, AI ‘art’ of Taylor Swift being sexually assaulted. It’s no coincidence that the internet’s largest directory of deepfakes uses <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2025/01/28/deepfake-porn-sites-link-to-tech-companies/\">Donald Trump as a mascot</a>. These attitudes are reflected in the upper echelons of the tech and AI industry. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman – the man we are being told is a generational talent, a revolutionary, on a par with Steve Jobs or Bill Gates – is also, allegedly, a rapist and paedophile, who considered his own sister his sexual property since she was three years old, and who responded to allegations by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6lq6x2gd9o\">lamenting</a> that “caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult.” A love of sexual violence is a key part of the identity of the contemporary right, and it is no coincidence that, the further right one goes, the more likely one is to encounter open celebration of rape and, particularly, paedophilia. Altman’s legal trouble will, for many on the right, only confirm that he is one of them. Meanwhile, on the Joe Rogan podcast, Mark Zuckerberg described the tech industry as “culturally neutered” and called for more “masculine energy” and “aggression”.</p>\n<p>Let’s return to Zuckerberg’s clothing. It was he that established the ubiquitous ‘grey hoodie’ style for tech CEOs. But recently he has begun to exhibit a new style. Oversized t-shirts emblazoned with ‘It’s either Zuck or Nothing’ in Latin, the unwieldy lines of his <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/09/26/smarter-ai-glasses-orion-and-judi-dench-sounding-ai-the-new-meta-tech-to-look-out-for\">Meta AI glasses</a>, a gaudy and unnecessary <a href=\"https://archive.ph/IHhFq\">gold chain</a>. This isn’t taking risks with fashion, like Rick Owens or Vivienne Westwood. It’s just ugly and stupid. Zuckerberg is also significantly more muscular than he used to be, despite doing nothing in his life that would seem to require a bodybuilder physique. I don’t think that it’s a coincidence that, as he embraces <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html\">corporate incelism</a> and AI, he has felt liberated to ignore what does and doesn’t look good, choosing instead to display that he is wealthy and powerful enough to look terrible if he wants. All the emperor has to do, when the child laughs at his nudity, is ignore them. Trump’s haircut, which we all seem to have become inured to, serves the same purpose. It looks like shit and that’s the point. It is a display of power and a small act of cruelty.</p>\n<p>The Cybertruck – itself a work of anti-art that could only be the product of a mind addled by the far right – failed, largely because it is embarrassing to be seen in one.</p>\n\n<section>\n<p>AI is a cruel technology. It replaces workers, devours millions of gallons of water, vomits CO2 into the atmosphere, propagandises exclusively for the worst ideologies, and fills the world with more ugliness and stupidity. Cruelty is the central tenet of right wing ideology. It is at the heart of everything they do. They are now quite willing to lose money or their lives in order to make the world a crueller place, and AI is a part of this – a mad rush to make a machine god that will liberate capital from labour for good. (This is no exaggeration: there is a lineage from OpenAI’s senior management back to the Lesswrong blog, originator of the concept of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rokos-basilisk\">Roko’s Basilisk</a>.) Moreso even than cryptocurrency, AI is entirely nihilistic, with zero redeeming qualities. It is a blight upon the world, and it will take decades to clear up the mountains of slop it has generated in the past two or three years.</p>\n<p>AI is, unfortunately, a fever that will have to burn itself out. It may be the case that, like cryptocurrency, elites are simply so invested in this technology that, despite its total lack of utility, they will keep trying to make it happen. Given how great a fit it is for them psychologically, I would say that this is more likely to happen than not. However, as we saw in those <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyjl912z7po\">two brief weeks</a> of last year’s US election campaign, the right wing psyche is incredibly fragile. For some reason, they are able to process any inversion of empirical reality, but are acutely sensitive to <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2023/11/08/celebrity-news/elon-musk-spiraled-after-being-booed-locked-himself-in-office/\">being laughed at</a>. Calling them weird absolutely works, and telling them their sole artistic output looks like shit also works. Laughing at people who treat AI art as in any way legitimate works. Talking about AI’s environmental impact or its implications for the workforce will not work - they like that, it makes them feel dangerous. Instead of talking about taking money from artists, talk about how it makes them look cheap. If hurting and offending people is part of the point, then we can take that fun away from them by refusing to express hurt or offence, even if we feel it. </p>\n<p>Technological progress isn’t linear, and it’s not wholly undemocratic. We, ordinary people, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052115/how-why-google-glass-failed.asp\">stopped Google Glass</a> from being widely released because we mocked its users, calling them ‘glassholes’. The Cybertruck – itself a work of anti-art that could only be the product of a mind addled by the far right – <a href=\"https://archive.ph/IHhFq\">failed</a>, largely because it is embarrassing to be seen in one. We have already seen that the AI industry is vulnerable – it was possible for Chinese grad students to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/nasdaq-futures-slump-as-china-s-deepseek-sparks-us-tech-concern?embedded-checkout=true\">build the same thing</a> for a fraction of the price, calling into question the entire model of growth through massive investment in data centres. The left is powerless across much of society, but a training in ruthless criticism of all that exists has made us masters of negativity, while always keeping one eye on the better world that is possible when the slop has been cleared away. Our most effective weapons against AI, and the right wing that has adopted it, may not be strikes, boycotts or the power of dialectics. They might be replying “cringe,” “this sucks,” and “this looks like shit.”</p>\n\n</section>\n</section>\n</section>\n</section>\n       </section>\n      </article>    \n        \n     \n    \n    </section>\n        \n    \n\n</div></div>",

            "htmlContent": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>A lot is happening in the world of artificial intelligence, and not a lot of it makes sense. We're told that AI is the future of business, yet it is wildly unprofitable; investment in AI companies is ramping up even as AI-adjacent tech stocks tumble; the American Plagiarism Machine is accusing the Chinese Plagiarism Machine of plagiarism. But nothing—nothing—is as head-spinning, as bizarre, or as infuriating as this, the bafflingly ubiquitous ad where renowned actors Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson hawk Salesforce's newest AI enterprise software product:</p><p>I want to note up front that my anger with this commercial is not because it is aimed at somebody who is not me. I've lived in D.C., and as such I am intimately familiar with seeing ads on the Metro designed to appeal exclusively to a handful of senators and Department of Defense procurement specialists. <em>Our Kinetic Weapon Systems Shred Human Bodies 15 Percent Faster Than Our Competitors ... Northrup Grumman: We Make The Possible Practical</em>, etc. I mostly do not mind when the ad I am watching is selling something I do not need and cannot buy for a business I do not run.</p><p>But this commercial? This one is different. The bewilderment and rage at this commercial has spread to all corners of the internet, including the hosts of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.fivefourpod.com/episodes/murphy-v-ncaa/\">legal podcast <em>5-4</em></a>, sportswriter <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-bowl-outrage-shrimp-in-the-rain-and-cowboys/id1788997372?i=1000686399835\">Katie Nolan</a>, and countless <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kevinmkruse.bsky.social/post/3lgof34vsms2i\">social</a> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/shadowtodd.bsky.social/post/3lgnuh5fhgk27\">media</a> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/hamlet10.bsky.social/post/3lgm5skd7ak2b\">posts</a>. It demands an explication, which I will do my best to provide to you at the cost of what is left of my sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>The ad—entitled \"Dining Alfiasco,\" its first and last moment of wit—begins with a thoroughly soaked McConaughey, sitting alone outside a restaurant in the middle of the pouring rain:</p><h5>\"The booking app I used didn't have Agentforce<sup>TM</sup>, so an AI agent didn't know to move my reservations inside...\"</h5><p>First off, the sheer density of this opening text rivals only \"He was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://defector.com/everything-i-remember-about-madame-web\">in the Amazon with my mom</a> when she was researching spiders just before she died\" in the modern canon. Subjects, objects, and causal relationships pummel and disorient the viewer like a flurry of jabs to the face. This will also be, incredibly, the least confusing part of this sentence.</p><p>This tell-don't-show exposition immediately raises numerous questions, none of which are answerable without descending into the mouth of madness. For starters: Wealthy and extremely famous person Matthew McConaughey makes his dinner reservations with a booking app? How many OpenTable points do we think he has? And what does it matter that his initial reservation was for a table outside; in what universe would a restaurant staff decide to seat anyone—let alone Matthew David Goddamn McConaughey—outside during a deluge? Were there no indoor tables available at this restaurant, or did they refuse to modify his reservation on principle? In either case, how would an AI agent powered by Agentforce<sup>TM</sup>—a cutting-edge digital labor platform, certainly, but not a miracle worker—accomplish what McConaughey apparently could not? And, why—for the love of God, <em>why</em>—would McConaughey let himself be seated outside during this downpour? Why has he decided to be complicit in his own abjection?</p><p>Also, note McConaughey's line reading here: He says that the absent-or-incompetent AI agent didn't know to move \"my reservations\" inside. (He says the line quickly, but he definitely says <em>reservations</em>, plural. By now, my relationship to this commercial is roughly that of Jim Garrison to the Zapruder film.) \"My reservations\" is either a perfect Freudian slip, a reveal that even McConaughey understands enough about AI to trigger subconscious anxiety, or—horrifyingly—an insinuation that this exact situation, which never has happened to anyone else, ever, has happened to Matthew McConaughey <em>multiple times</em>.</p><p>The ad continues, with McConaughey disdainfully considering a shrimp cocktail before shoving it away:</p><h5>\"...or know what I like to eat, which is not that.\"</h5><p>With this, the ad moves from the merely inexplicable to the thoroughly insane. McConaughey is dining—or attempting to dine, given adverse conditions—at a restaurant where they <em>bring food to you unbidden</em>? The simple act and near-universal social custom of perusing a menu of available dishes and communicating what you want to the kitchen, either directly or through a go-between, has been abandoned at this establishment? The thoroughly solved problem of obtaining the food that you want from an establishment that sells food—at least as, if not more, thoroughly solved than the problem of water falling from the sky onto your body—now requires <em>AI</em> to ensure that people don't incorrectly get what they didn't order?</p><p>It is simply wild that Salesforce has this opportunity to highlight to a mass audience, even indirectly, their best and most promising use-case for AI, and here they are aggressively pitching an inscrutable solution to a non-existent problem. What often ruins advertisements aimed at the highest socioeconomic strata is a lack of relatability. (<em>Is your banged-up old car elevator ruining your enjoyment of your Maui beach house?</em>) In a mind-bending twist, that is not the problem here. The basics of this premise—a restaurant, a table, food, even a booking app—are <em>extremely</em> relatable to almost everyone. What makes this commercial an avant-garde experience is that at no point are the people on-screen relating to these perfectly ordinary things in a way that any human ever has. Booking apps are in charge of ordering the food while the restaurants abuse their patrons, and in Rand McNally hamburgers eat people.</p><p>The only true note in all of this is that it is totally believable that Matthew McConaughey finds a mere shrimp cocktail beneath <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@burcu.cooks/video/7438682125181750561\">his enlightened palate</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, though, we return to the central question: <em>Why is he just sitting there?</em> He is deliberately immiserating himself through inaction, while the only people who could conceivably help him are instead making his situation worse. <em>Nobody</em> should be treated like this, let alone an Oscar-winning actor, Lincoln Motor Company in-house poet, and the man famous for playing Wooderson, the charming and eminently quotable pedophile from <em>Dazed and Confused</em>. Why won’t he leave??? Everyone is acting like it has to be this way, but it ... just ... doesn't?</p><p>It is at this moment that the true terror sets in. This ad is not a sales pitch; it is a vision of the dystopia to come. The world depicted in this commercial is one where AI has come to dominate our lives. AI will be what intermediates you and other human beings, it will direct you where to go and what to do, it will give you what it decides to give you, its decisions are binding on you and others, its judgment is irreversible, and you will have to sit there and take it.&nbsp;</p><p>The only choice you have here is to choose which machine makes your choices for you. Salesforce promises that Agentforce<sup>TM</sup> AI will allow you to \"unlock human success,\" but this ad reveals that the opposite is true: It will, at best, construct for you a higher-quality prison. This situation is unbearably bleak, until:&nbsp;</p><h5>\"What's up, my brother?\" \"Oh, hey, bud!\"</h5><p>Suddenly, we see our hero, Woody Harrelson, dining at a restaurant across the street and oafishly grinning at the predicament McConaughey has found himself in. Harrelson's dinner companions are a man and a woman of indeterminable age and mysterious relation; McConaughey's debasement brings peals of laughter from the man and a look of abject horror from the woman. Neither speaks, and it is plausible that they exist only because it would be sad to show Harrelson dining alone. Could they be AI-generated? My thoughts are indistinguishable from Rorschach diary entries at this point.</p><p>Two things are immediately evident upon the Harrelson reveal. First—and, for me, the most important—there is the tantalizing possibility that what we're seeing is happening in the world of <em>True Detective</em>, Season 1. To those skeptical of this reading, I ask: Who is more likely to sit in obvious discomfort for reasons they cannot articulate, international superstar Matthew McConaughey or self-destructive nihilist Rust Cohle? (\"I tell myself I bear witness, but the real answer is that it's obviously my programming, and I lack the constitution for suicide.\") And if anyone would forego human connection and give himself over to an AI-powered ubermensch—though one sadly lacking Agentforce<sup>TM</sup>'s powerful Atlas Reasoning Engine and specialized, always-on support—wouldn't it be someone who has witnessed firsthand man's inhumanity to man, and is also in possession of an A.J. Soprano–level understanding of Nietzsche? (\"Why should I live in history, huh? Fuck, I don't wanna know anything anymore. This is a world where nothing is solved.\") You can see it, right?</p><p>In any event, the second thing you notice is what doesn't happen next. In a normal commercial, it would be revealed that Harrelson did what McConaughey failed to do: namely, that he had used a booking app that <em>does</em> have Agentforce<sup>TM</sup>, and as a result <em>its</em> AI agent—no doubt using its seamless integration with the Salesforce ecosystem—<em>did</em> know to seat diners where it is dry instead of where it is wet. This is Advertising 101: You introduce Goofus, who doesn't use your product, and therefore is sad; then you show Gallant, who does use your product, and therefore is happy.</p><p>I very much dislike these kinds of ads—the sputtering emasculation of Goofus, the tired gender stereotype of Goofus's harumphing wife, the thought of disappointing those that I love with my poor choice of interior wall paint—and yet there is no catharsis in an ad that shows Goofus's pain without Gallant's triumph. But imagine, just <em>imagine</em>, Harrelson turning to the camera and saying something like:&nbsp;</p><p>\"Thankfully, my booking app had Agentforce<sup>TM</sup> powering its AI agent, and that's the reason why I moved indoors during a storm and that's why this restaurant served me the food that I wanted.\"</p><p>That pitch never comes, for the obvious reason that it would make absolutely no goddamn sense. Still, its absence gives the whole game away: Nobody in this commercial, or anywhere, actually needs any of this shit. There is no evidence that the other, competent restaurant uses AI at all, or that the other diners needed an AI agent in a booking app to get themselves out of the rain, or that the Harrelson throuple did anything other than order their food off a menu like actual human beings. They are normal people doing normal things in a normal way; only McConaughey needs the power of AI to avoid rain and purchase food, two things mankind has been doing successfully for thousands of years.</p><p>After some small talk about the necessity of the rain <em>(... reference to horrors of climate change or mere coincidence? ... hunrh ... must investigate further ...</em>), Harrelson finally extends his hand:</p><h5>\"Paddle on over! We got you, brother.\"</h5><p>Harrelson considers McConaughey in a way that AI could never: as a person, with autonomy and agency. Harrelson reaches out to him with love, beckoning him back to humanity. In doing so, Harrelson gives McConaughey that which had been taken from him, that what he could not see he needed: a choice. He is free to leave this cursed place, and at long last, become fully himself again. </p><p>As McConaughey gets up to cross the street, the tagline flashes:</p><h5>What AI Was Meant To Be</h5><p>Given what we've seen here, it is clear what AI is meant to be. AI is meant to be ignored, discarded, rejected in favor of the shelter of community and the warm embrace of a friend. Rust Cohle, again:</p><blockquote><p>To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Come on. It kinda works, right?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>",

You should treat my claims with appropriate skepticism - I’m saying that a lot of public thinking and academic research about social media is chasing after the wrong target, on the basis of (a) my idiosyncratic reading of social theory, and (b) my partial understanding of current events. But at the least, my approach provides a superficially coherent account of how the relationship between social media and democracy is changing in the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, we have seen Elon Musk transforming X/Twitter into a kind of deranged parallel universe out of a Philip K. Dick novel, in which the political realities of the US, UK and Germany are re-arranging themselves around the obsessions of an unelected individual. Now, Mark Zuckerberg seems to be taking the guardrails off Meta’s social media services. </p><p><span>My explanation of what is happening is this. We tend to think of the problem of social media as a problem of </span><em>disinformation</em><span> - that is, of people receiving erroneous information and being convinced that false things are in fact true. Hence, we can try to make social media better through factchecking, through educating people to see falsehoods and similar. This is, indeed, a problem, but it is not the most important one. The fundamental problem, as I see it, is not that social media </span><em>misinforms individuals</em><span> about what is true or untrue but that it creates </span><em>publics with malformed collective understandings</em><span>. That is a more subtle problem, but also a more pernicious one. Explaining it is going to require some words. Bear with me.</span></p><p>*****</p><p>The fundamental problem is this: we tend to think about democracy as a phenomenon that depends on the knowledge and capacities of individual citizens, even though, like markets and bureaucracies, it is a profoundly collective enterprise. That in turn leads us to focus on how social media shapes individual knowledge, for better or worse, and to mistake symptoms for causes.</p><p>A lot of argument about democracy - both in public and among the academics who inquire into it - makes heroic claims about the wisdom and intelligence of individual citizens. We want citizens who are wise, well informed and willing to think about the collective good. Sometimes, we even believe that citizens are all these things.</p><p><span>The problem is that actual individual citizens are biased and, on average, not particularly knowledgeable about politics. This mismatch between rhetoric and reality has created opportunities for a minor academic industry of libertarians and conservatives arguing that democracy is unworkable and that we should rely instead on well informed elites to rule. The problem with this elitist case against democracy is that elites are just as biased, and furthermore are liable to use their greater knowledge to bolster their biases rather than correct them (for the extended version of this riposte, </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/68/the-new-libertarian-elitists/\">see this essay</a><span> by Hugo Mercier, Melissa Schwartzberg and myself). The problem of human bias goes all the way down.</span></p><p><span>So what can we do to ameliorate this problem? Making individuals better at thinking and seeing the blind spots in their own individual reasoning will only go so far. What we need are better </span><em>collective</em><span> means of thinking. As Hugo, Melissa and I argue </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/analytical-democratic-theory-a-microfoundational-approach/739A9A928A99A47994E4585059B03398\">here</a><span> (academic article, but I think fairly readable), much of the work on human cognitive bias suggests that people can actually think much better collectively than individually, offering prospects for a different understanding of democracy, in which my pig-headed advocacy for my particular flawed perspective allows me to see the flaws in your pig-headed arguments and point them out with gusto, and vice versa, for the general improvement of our thought. </span></p><p><span>This is a particular version of an argument that is made more generally by Herbert Simon. There are sharp limits to </span><em>individual</em><span> human cognition, but we have invented </span><em>collective</em><span> means to think better together. Brad DeLong has a </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://braddelong.substack.com/p/what-the-east-african-plains-ape?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=47874&amp;post_id=152762104&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=byas&amp;triedRedirect=true\">nice phrase</a><span> for the specific advantage of the human species - “anthology intelligence” - which captures this. Markets, bureaucracies, and indeed democracy can all serve as collective means of problem solving and compensation for individual deficiencies, under the right circumstances. But the qualifying phrase, ‘under the right circumstances,’ is key. All of these institutional forms have failure modes.</span></p><p>To understand the particular success and failure modes of democracy, it is better not to focus on individual citizens, but on democratic publics. Democracy is supposed to be a system in which political decisions are taken not by kings, or dictators, but by the public, or by representative agents that are responsible to the public and can be removed through elections or similar. In principle, then, the public is the aggregated beliefs and wants of the citizenry as a whole. </p><p><span>The problem is that we have no way to </span><em>directly see</em><span> what all the citizens want and believe, or to make full sense of it. So instead we rely on a variety of representative technologies to make the public visible, in more or less imperfect ways. Voting is one such technology - and different voting systems tend to lead to quite different manifestations of the public. “First past the post” systems like the U.S. and United Kingdom tend to produce publics in which political contention is channeled through competition between </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law\">two opposed parties</a><span>, as opposed to many smaller parties.</span></p><p><span>Opinion polls are another. They now seem quite natural to us as a gauge of public opinion, but as Andy Perrin and Katherine McFarland </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1886852\">argue</a><span>, they seemed strange and unnatural when they were first introduced. </span></p><p><span>More importantly, all these systems are not just passive measures of public opinion but active forces that rework it. As Perrin and McFarland say, “Publics are evoked, even shaped, by [the] techniques that represent them.” Human beings are coalitional animals. We appear to have </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300248548/minds-make-societies/\">specialized subsystems in our brain</a><span> for understanding what the group politics are in a given situation; who is opposed to who, and what the opportunities are. </span></p><p><span>In Perrin and McFarland’s example, when Republicans said in polls that Barack Obama was a secret Muslim, they did not believe this claim in the same way that they believed that water was wet. Instead, their claim had some of the qualities of what Hugo and Dan Sperber call a “</span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27009\">reflective belief</a><span>,” and some of the qualities of a shibboleth - something that you know you are supposed to believe, and publicly affirm that you believe but might or might not subscribe to personally.*</span></p><p>In short, the technologies through which we see the public shape what we think the public is. And that, in turn, shapes how we behave politically and how we orient ourselves. We may end up believing - in a highly specific way - in things that we know we are ‘supposed’ to believe, given that we are Republicans or Democrats, Conservative or Labour Party members. We may end up not believing these things, but also declining to express our actual beliefs publicly, because we know we’re not supposed to believe whatever it is that we privately think. The coalitions that we create, the political battles that we imagine ourselves as engaged in, may also depend on the technologies and the particular fights and issues that they highlight.</p><p><span>This can, under the right circumstances, be roughly to the good. Coalitional politics and disputes are inevitably messy and contentious - but they can be turned towards useful ends. When there are moderate political incentives towards error correction (people feel some obligation to revise their most stupid views in response to well-aimed criticism), small-n pig-headed contention can scale up into forms of competition in which </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148144/on-the-side-of-the-angels?srsltid=AfmBOopmHw8nmulTjdGO4LK7lXd9bqzC3ODeCVHOzFxWQeGP_ZttERBD\">different parties battle it out</a><span> to provide some rough version of the public good. That has its own problems, but given the ways in which human brains work, it is probably as good as we can reasonably hope to get. It can also turn bad, when pig-headedness feeds on itself and becomes self-reinforcing.</span></p><p><span>Bringing this all together, </span><em>the technologies through which we see the public shape how we understand it</em><span>, making it more likely that we end up in the one situation rather than the other. </span><em> </em><span>As you have surely guessed by now, I believe Twitter/X, Facebook, and other social media services are just such technologies for shaping publics. Many of the problems that we are going to face over the next many years will stem from publics that have been deranged and distorted by social media in ways that lower the odds that democracy will be a problem solving system, and increase the likelihood that it will be a problem creating one.</span></p><p><span>The example that really made me think about how this works has nothing much to do with democracy or political theory. It was the thesis of an article published in </span><em>Logic </em><span>magazine in 2019, </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://logicmag.io/play/my-stepdad's-huge-data-set/\">about Internet porn</a><span>. The article’s argument is that the presentation of porn - and people’s sense of what other people’s sexual interests are - is shaped by algorithms that respond to the sharp difference between what people want to see and what people are willing to pay for. The key claim:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>a lot of people .. are consumers of internet porn (i.e., they watch it but don’t pay for it), a tiny fraction of those people are </span><em>customers</em><span>. </span><em>Customers</em><span> pay for porn, typically by clicking an ad on a tube site, going to a specific content site (often owned by MindGeek), and entering their credit card information. … This “consumer” vs. “customer” division is key to understanding the use of data to perpetuate categories that seem peculiar to many people both inside and outside the industry. … Porn companies, when trying to figure out what people want, focus on the customers who convert. It’s their tastes that set the tone for professionally produced content and the industry as a whole.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The result is that particular taboos (incest; choking) feature heavily in the presentation of Internet porn, not because they are the most popular among consumers, but because they are more likely to convert into paying customers. This, in turn, gives porn consumers, including teenagers, </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/sep/02/i-think-its-natural-why-has-sexual-choking-become-so-prevalent-among-young-people\">a highly distorted understanding</a><span> of what other people want and expect from sex, that some of them then act on. In my terms, they look through a distorting technological lens on an imaginary sexual public to understand what is normal and expected, and what is not. This then shapes their interactions with others. </span></p><p>Something like this explains the main consequences of social media for politics. The collective perspectives that emerge from social media - our understanding of what the public is and wants - are similarly shaped by algorithms that select on some aspects of the public, while sidelining others. And we tend to orient ourselves towards that understanding, through a mixture of reflective beliefs, conformity with shibboleths, and revised understandings of coalitional politics. </p><p><span>This isn’t brainwashing - people don’t have to internalize this or that aspect of what social media presents to them, radically changing their beliefs and their sense of who they are. That sometimes happens, but likely far more rarely than we think. The more important change is to our beliefs about </span><em>what other people think, </em><span>which we perpetually update based on social observation. When what we observe is filtered through social media, our understandings of the coalitions we belong to, and the coalitions we oppose, what we have in common, and what we disagree on, shift too.</span></p><p>*****</p><p>This leads to a different theory of what is wrong with social media than the usual one, although there is some overlap (a lot of the research that has been done is still useful). If we think that the big problem is disinformation, which might persuade individuals that what is false is in fact true, we are likely to look to one set of remedies. If we think of the problem as malformed publics, then we are in much bigger trouble, without any very obvious technical fixes. Any possible solutions involve collective politics in a world where collective politics are only getting harder. </p><p><span>Over the last two weeks, Elon Musk has used Twitter/X to derail a Congressional budget resolution (writing “Vox Populi, Vox Dei” after he won), to reshape the political debate in the United Kingdom around a two decades old scandal so as to heighten tensions around Muslim immigration, and to elevate the German far-right AfD party as the only solution to Germany’s problems. This morning, Mark Zuckerberg </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/brianfung.me/post/3lf5ngc7rrk2r\">announced</a><span> that Facebook is moving away from “censorship mistakes,” removing restrictions on “gender and immigration,” and allying with Trump to “push back against foreign governments” (i.e. the EU) that want “American companies to censor more.” These moves are reshaping politics so that they center around the issues that Musk cares about, and that Zuckerberg either cares about or sees as politically convenient to his interests.</span></p><p>The resulting problems are not primarily problems of disinformation, though disinformation plays some role. They are the problems you get when large swathes of the public sphere are exclusively owned by wannabe God-Emperors. Elon Musk owns X/Twitter outright. Mark Zuckerberg controls Meta through a system in which he is CEO, chairman and effective majority owner, all at the same time. What purports to be a collective phenomena; the ‘voice of the people;’ is actually in private hands; is, to a very great extent shaped by two extremely powerful individuals. </p><p>Musk and Zuckerberg are different individuals, with different relationships to their platforms. I expect that the distortions that they impose on their publics will be quite different too. </p><p><span>Specifically: Musk directly and repeatedly intervenes to ensure that everything revolves around him, through an algorithm that privileges his posts and pile-ons, through revocations of privileges for those who challenge him, and other means. And he posts incessantly. The result is that X/Twitter is a Pornhub where everything is twisted around the particular kinks of a specific, and visibly disturbed individual. Whatever Musk wants, as the Voice of God, may or may not become the Voice of the People, but is probably what the people are going to end up talking about, whether they want to or not. This is what gives X/Twitter its Philip K. Dick quality - it’s like Dick’s novel </span><em>Ubik</em><span>, in which the characters repeatedly find their world being pulled back into the mental patterns of a predatory teenager-turned-existential-vampire, Jory Miller.</span></p><p>Zuckerberg’s social-media-shaped public does not turn around Zuckerberg in the same way. But even so, Zuckerberg is reshaping the algorithms so that some aspects of the public - in particular hostility to immigration, to women and to sexual minorities - will likely come to the fore, while others will recede. The extent to which this reflects his changing personal preferences, as opposed to his willingness to strike a deal with Trump is of secondary importance. It isn’t his personality so much as his interests that are likely to dominate.</p><p><span>Again: none of this is brainwashing, but it </span><em>is</em><span> reshaping public debate, not just in the US, but in the UK, Europe and other places too. People’s sense of the contours of politics - what is legitimate and what is out of bounds; what others think and are likely to do and how they ought respond - is visibly changing around us.</span></p><p>That poses some immediate questions. Can democracy work, if a couple of highly atypical men exercise effective control over large swathes of the public space? How can that control be limited or counteracted, even in principle? What practical steps for reform are available in a democracy shaped by the people who you want to reform out of power? </p><p>It poses some more general questions too. If you want to work towards a better system of democracy, which is both more stable and more actually responsive to what people want and need, how do you do this? It is easy (I think personally, but I am biased too) to see what is wrong with the public at X/Twitter. It is harder to think clearly about what a healthy public would look like, let alone how to build one.</p><p>I don’t have good answers to these questions; just questions. Still, I think they are the questions we need to ask to better understand the situation that is developing around us right now.</p><p><span>* </span><a rel=\"\" href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/formal-models-of-authoritarian-regimes-a-critique/AED030168CCBB46CAB879D4A380954AA\">Adam Przeworski</a><span> describes the following Polish joke from the period of authoritarian rule. “Comrade Secretary delivers a speech on “The Dangers of American Imperialism.” Then all the comrades in the room express their opinions.

He is also a senior fellow of Schmidt Sciences’ AI2050 initiative and a senior visiting fellow at Google.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Tobias Rees, founder of an AI studio located at the intersection of philosophy, art and technology, sat down with Noema Editor-in-Chief Nathan Gardels to discuss the philosophical significance of generative AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan Gardels: </strong>What remains unclear to us humans is the nature of machine intelligence we have created through AI and how it changes our own understanding of ourselves. What is your perspective as a philosopher who has contemplated this issue not from within the Ivory Tower, but “in the wild,” in the engineering labs at Google and elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Tobias Rees: </strong>AI profoundly challenges how we have understood ourselves.</p><p>Why do I think so?</p><p>We humans live by a large number of conceptual presuppositions. We may not always be aware of them — and yet they are there and shape how we think and understand ourselves and the world around us. Collectively, they are the logical grid or architecture that underlies our lives.</p><p>What makes AI such a profound philosophical event is that it defies many of the most fundamental, most taken-for-granted concepts — or philosophies — that have defined the modern period and that most humans still mostly live by. It literally renders them insufficient, thereby marking a deep caesura.</p><p>Let me give a concrete example. One of the most fundamental assumptions of the modern period has been that there is a clear-cut distinction between us humans and machines.</p><p>Here humans, living organisms; open and evolving; beings that are equipped with intelligence and, thus, with interiority.</p><p>There machines, lifeless, mechanical things; closed, determined and deterministic systems devoid of intelligence and interiority.</p><p>This distinction, which first surfaced in the 1630s, was constitutive of the modern notion of what it is to be human. For example, almost the entire vocabulary that was invented between the 17th and 19th centuries to capture what it truly is to be human was grounded in the human/intelligence-machine/mechanism distinction.</p><p>Agency, art, creativity, consciousness, culture, existence, freedom, history, knowledge, language, morals, play, politics, society, subjectivity, truth, understanding. All of these concepts were introduced with the explicit purpose of providing us with an understanding of what is truly unique human potential, a uniqueness that was grounded in the belief that intelligence is what lifts us above everything else — and that everything else ultimately can be sufficiently described as a closed, determined mechanical system.</p><p>The human-machine distinction provided modern humans with a scaffold for how to understand themselves and the world around them. The philosophical significance of AIs — of built, technical systems that are intelligent — is that they break this scaffold.</p><p>What that means is that an epoch that was stable for almost 400 years comes — or appears to come — to an end.</p><p>Poetically put, it is a bit as if AI releases ourselves and the world from the understanding of ourselves and the world we had. It leaves us in the open.</p><p>I am adamant that those who build AI understand the philosophical stakes of AI. That is why I became, as you put it, a philosopher in the wild.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>You say that AI is intelligent. But many people doubt that AI is “really” intelligent. They view it as just another tool like all previous human-invented technologies.</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>In my experience, this question is almost always grounded in a defensive impulse. A sometimes angry, sometimes anxious effort to hold on to or to re-inscribe the old distinctions. I think of it as a nostalgia for human exceptionalism, that is, a longing for a time when we humans thought there was only one form of intelligence, us.</p><p>AI teaches us that this is not so. And not just AI, of course. Over the last two decades or so the concept of intelligence has multiplied. We now know that there are lots of other kinds of intelligence: from bacteria to octopi, from Earth systems to the spiral arms of galaxies. We are an entry in a series. And so is AI.</p><p>To argue that these other things are not “really” intelligent because their intelligence differs from ours is a bit silly. That would be like one species of birds, say Pelicans, insisting that only Pelicans “really” know how to fly.</p><p>It is best if we get rid of the “really” and simply acknowledge that AI <em>is</em> intelligent, if in ways slightly different from us.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>What is intelligence?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>Today, we appear to know that there are some baseline qualities to intelligence such as learning from experience, logical understanding and the capability to abstract from what one has learned to solve novel situations.</p><p>AI systems have all these qualities. They learn, they logically understand and they form abstractions that allow them to navigate new situations.</p><p>However, what experience or learning or understanding or abstraction means for an AI system and for us humans is not quite the same. That is why I suggested that AI is intelligently slightly different from us.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “AI defies many of the most fundamental, most taken-for-granted concepts — or philosophies — that have defined the modern period and that most humans still mostly live by.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>AI may be another kind of intelligence, but can we say it is, or can be, smarter than us?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>For me, the question is not necessarily whether or not AI is smarter than us, but whether or not our different intelligences can be complementary. Can we be smarter together?</p><p>Let me sketch some of the differences I am seeing.</p><p>AI can operate on scales — both micro and macro — that are beyond human logical comprehension and capability.</p><p>For example, AI has much more information available than we do and it can access and work through this information faster than we can. It also can discover logical structures in data — patterns — where we see nothing.</p><p>Perhaps one must pause for a moment to recognize how extraordinary this is.</p><p>AI can literally give us access to spaces that we, on our own, qua human, cannot discover and cannot access. How amazing is this? There are already many examples of this. They range from discovering new moves in games like Go or Chess to discovering how protein folds to understanding whole Earth systems.</p><p>Given these more than human qualities one could say that AI is smarter than us.</p><p>However, human smartness is not reducible to the kind of intelligence or smartness AI has. It has additional dimensions, ones that AI seems to not have.</p><p>The perhaps most important of these additional dimensions is our individual need to live a human life.</p><p>What does that mean? At the very least it means that we humans navigate the outside world in terms of our inside worlds. We must orient ourselves by way of thinking, in terms of a thinking self. These thinking selves must understand, make sense of, and be struck by, insights.</p><p>No matter how smart AI, is it cannot be smart for me. It can provide me with information, it can even engage me in a thought process, but I still need to orient myself in terms of my thinking. I still need to have my own experiences and my own insights, insights that enable me to live my life.</p><p>That said, AI, the specific non-human smartness it has, can be incredibly helpful when it comes to leading a human life.</p><p>The most powerful example I can think of is that it can make the self visible to itself in ways we humans cannot.</p><p>Imagine an on-device AI system — an AI model that exists only on your devices and is not connected to the internet — that has access to all your data. Your emails, your messages, your documents, your voice memos, your photos, your songs, etc.</p><p>I stress on-device because it matters that no third parties have access to your data.</p><p>Such an AI system can make me visible to myself in ways neither I nor any other human can. It literally can lift me above me. It can show me myself from outside of myself, show me the patterns of thoughts and behaviors that have come to define me. It can help me understand these patterns and it can discuss with me whether they are constraining me, and if so, then how. What is more, it can help me work on those patterns and, where appropriate, enable me to break from them and be set free.</p><p>Philosophically put, AI can help me transform myself into an “object of thought” to which I can relate and on which I can work.</p><p>The work of the self on the self has formed the core of what Greek philosophers called meletē and Roman philosophers meditatio. And the kind of AI system I evoke here would be a philosopher’s dream. It could make us humans visible to ourselves in ways no human interlocutor can, from outside of us, free from conversational narcissism.</p><p>You see, there can be incredible beauty in the overlap and the difference between our intelligence and that of AI.</p><p>Ultimately, I do not think of AI as a self-enclosed, autonomous entity that is in competition with us. Rather, I think of it as a relation.</p><p><strong>Gardels:</strong>What is specifically new that distinguishes deep learning-based AI systems from the old human/machine dichotomy?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>The kind of AI that ruled from the 1950s to the early 2000s was an attempt to think about the human from within the vocabulary provided by machines. It was an explicit, self-conscious attempt by engineers to explain all things human from within the conceptual space of the possibility of machines.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “AI could make us humans visible to ourselves in ways no human interlocutor can, from outside of us, free from conversational narcissism.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>It was called “symbolic AI” because the basic idea behind these systems was that we could store knowledge in mathematical symbols and then equip computers with rules for how to derive relevant answers from those symbolic representations.</p><p>Some philosophers, most famously Herbert Dreyfus and John Searl, were very much provoked by this. They set out to defend the idea that humans are more than machines, more than rule-based algorithms.</p><p>But the kind of AI that that has risen to prominence since the early 2010s, so called deep learning systems or deep neural networks, are of an altogether different kind.</p><p>Symbolic AI systems, like all prior machines, were closed, determined systems. That means, first, that they were limited in what they could do by the rules we gave them. When they encountered a situation that was not covered by the rules, they failed. Let’s say they had no adaptive, no learning behavior. And it means as well that what they could do was entirely reducible to the engineers who built them. They could, ultimately, only do things we had explicitly instructed them to do. That is, they had no agency, no agentive capabilities of their own. In short, they were tools.</p><p>With deep learning systems, this is different. We do not give them their knowledge. We do not program them. Rather, they learn on their own, for themselves, and, based on what they have learned, they can navigate situations or answer questions they have never seen before. That is, they are no longer closed, deterministic systems.</p><p>Instead they have a sort of openness and a sort of agentive behavior, a deliberation or decision-making space, that no technical system before them ever had. Some people say AI has “only” pattern recognition. But I think pattern recognition is actually a form of discovering the logical structure of things. Roughly, when you have a student who identifies the logical principles that underlie data and who can answer questions based on these logical principles, wouldn’t you call that understanding?</p><p>In fact, one can push that a step further and say that AI systems appear to be capable of distinguishing truths from falsehoods. That’s because truth is positively correlated with a consistent logical structure. Errors, so to speak, are all unique or different. While the truth is not. And what we see in AI models is that they can distinguish between statements that conform to the patterns that they discover and statements that don’t.</p><p>So in that sense, AI systems have a nascent sense of truth.</p><p>Simply put, deep learning systems have qualities that, up until recently, were considered possible only for living organisms in general and for humans in particular.</p><p>Today’s AI systems have qualities of both –– and, thereby, are reducible to neither. They exist in between the old distinctions and show that the either-or logic that organized our understanding of reality –– either human or machine, either alive or not, either natural or artificial, either being or thing –– is profoundly insufficient.</p><p>Insofar as AI escapes these binary distinctions, it leads us into a terrain for which we have no words.</p><p>We could say, it opens up the world for us. It makes reality visible to us in ways we have never seen before. It shows us that we can understand and experience reality and ourselves in ways that lie outside of the logical distinctions that organized the modern period.</p><p>In some sense, we can see as if for the first time.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>So, deep-learning systems are not just tools, but agents with a degree of autonomy?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>This question is a good example to showcase that AI is indeed philosophically new.</p><p>We used to think that agency has two prerequisites, being alive and having interiority, that is, a sense of self or consciousness. Now, what we can learn from AI systems is that this is apparently not the case. There are things that have agency but that are not alive and that do not have consciousness or a mind, at least not in the way we have previously understood these terms.</p><p>This insight, this decoupling of agency from life and from interiority, is a powerful invitation to see the world — and ourselves — differently.</p><p>For example, is what is true for agency — that it doesn’t need life and interiority — also true for things like intelligence, creativity or language? And how would we classify or categorize things in the world differently if this were the case?</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “What makes AI a philosophical event is that these systems defy the formerly clear-cut distinction between humans and machines or between living things and nonliving things.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>In her <a data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/ai-is-life/\">essay</a> in Noema, the astrophysicist Sarah Walker said that “we need to get past our binary categorization of all things as either life or not.”</p><p>What interests me most is rethinking the concepts we have inherited from the modern period, from the perspective of the <em>in-betweenness</em> made visible to us by AI.</p><p>What is creativity from the perspective of the in-betweenness of AI? What language? What mind?</p><h2 id=\"h-ii-a-new-aixial-age\"><strong>II. A New AIxial Age?</strong></h2><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>Karl Jaspers was best known for his study of the so-called Axial Age when all the great religions and philosophies were born in relative simultaneity over two millennia ago — Confucianism in China, the Upanishads and Buddhism in India, Homer’s Greece and the Hebrew prophets. Jaspers saw these civilizations arising in the long wake of what he called “the first Promethean Age” of man’s appropriation of fire and earliest inventions.</p><p>For Charles Taylor, the first Axial Age resulted from the “great dis-embedding” of the person from isolated communities and their natural environment, where circumscribed awareness had been limited to the sustenance and survival of the tribe guided by oral narrative myth. The lifting out from a closed-off world, according to Taylor, was enabled by the arrival of written language. This attainment of symbolic competency capacitated an “interiority of reflection” based on abiding texts that created a platform for shared meanings beyond one’s immediate circumstances and local narratives.</p><p>Long story very short, this “transcendence” in turn led to the possibility of general philosophies, monotheistic religions and broad-based ethical systems. The critical self-distancing element of dis-embedded reflection further evolved into what the sociologist Robert Bellah called “theoretic culture,” to scientific discovery and the Enlightenment that spawned modernity. For Bellah, “Plato completed the transition to the Axial Age,” with the idea of&nbsp;theoria&nbsp;that “enables the mind to ‘view’ the great and the small in themselves abstracted from their concrete manifestations.”</p><p>The big question is whether the new level of symbolic competence reached by AI will play a similar role in fostering a “New AIxial Age” as written language did the first time around, when it gave rise to new philosophies, ethical systems and religions.</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>I am not sure today’s AI systems have what the modern period came to call symbolic competence.</p><p>That is related to what we’ve already discussed.</p><p>There was, ever since John Locke, the idea that we humans have a mind in which we store experiences in the form of symbols or symbolic representations and then we derive answers from these symbols.</p><p>Let’s say this conceptualization was understood throughout the modern period to be the basic infrastructure of intelligence.</p><p>In the late 19th century, philosophers like Ernst Cassirer gave this a twist. He suggested that the key to understanding what it is to be human is to see that we humans invent symbols or meaning and that symbol-making or meaning-making is what sets us apart as a species from everything else.</p><p>Deep learning, in general, and generative AI in particular, have broken with this human-centric concept of intelligence and replaced it with something else: The idea that intelligence is pretty much two things: learning and reasoning.</p><p>Essentially, learning means the capacity to discover abstract logical principles that organize the things we want to learn. Whether this is an actual data set or learning experiences that we humans make, there is no difference. Call it logical understanding.</p><p>The second defining feature of intelligence is the capacity to continuously and steadily refine and update these abstract logical principles, these understandings, and to apply them –– by way of reasoning –– to situations we live in and that we must navigate or solve.</p><p>Deep learning systems are most excellent at the first part –– but not so much the second. Basically, once they are trained, they cannot revise the things they have learned. They can only infer.</p><p>Be that as it may, there is nothing much symbolic here. At least not in the classical sense of the term.</p><p>I am emphasizing this absence of the symbolic because it is a beautiful way to show that deep learning has led to a pretty powerful philosophical rupture: Implicit in the new concept of intelligence is a radically different ontological understanding of what it is to be human, indeed, of what reality is or of how it is structured and organized.</p><p>Understanding this rupture with the older concept of intelligence and ontology of the human/the world is key, I think, to understanding your actual question: Are we entering what you call a new AIxial age, where AI will amount to something similar to what writing amounted to roughly 3,000 to 2,000 years ago?</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “Are we entering what you call a new AIxial age, where AI will amount to something similar to what writing amounted to roughly 3,000 to 2,000 years ago?”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>If we are lucky, the answer is yes. The potential is absolutely there.</p><p>But let me try to articulate what I think the challenge is so we truly can make this possible.</p><p>Let’s take the correlation between the emergence of writing, the birth of a vocabulary of interiority, and the rise of abstract or theoretical thought as our starting point.</p><p>I will do what I tried to do in my prior responses: Reflect on the historicity of the concepts we live by, point out how recent they are, that there is nothing timeless or universal about them, and then ask if AI challenges and changes them.</p><p>There is a beautiful book by Bruno Snell called “Die Entdeckung des Geistes” or, in an excellent English translation, “The Discovery of the Mind.”</p><p>The work’s central thesis is that what we today call “mind,” “consciousness” and “inner life” is not a given. It is nothing that has always existed or was always experienced. Instead, it is a concept that only gradually emerged.</p><p>In beautiful, captivating prose Snell traces the earliest instances of the birth of what I think of as “a vocabulary of interiority.”</p><p>For example, he shows that in Homer’s works, there is no general, abstract concept of “mind” or “soul.” Instead, there is a whole flurry of terms that are very difficult to translate. For example, <em>thymos</em>, which is perhaps best articulated as a passion that overcomes and consumes one, or <em>noos</em>, which originally meant sensory awareness and psyche, is a term that Homer and his contemporaries most often meant “breath” or that which animates, but not what we would call psyche today.</p><p>Simply put, there is absolutely no vocabulary of interiority in Homer. Or in Hesiod.</p><p>This changes at the turn from Archaic to Classical Greek. We begin to see the birth of a vocabulary of interiority and increasingly sophisticated ways of describing inner experience. The most important reference here is probably Sappho. Her poetry is among the very first explorations of what we today would call subjective experience and individual emotion.</p><p>I do not want to derail us by retelling the whole of Snell’s book. Rather, what interests me is to convey a sense of the possibility that we discussed earlier: We humans have not always experienced ourselves the way we do today. Every form of experience and thinking or understanding is conceptually mediated. This is also true, perhaps particularly so, for the idea of interiority and inner life.</p><p>Snell’s book is so wonderful because he shows the discontinuous, gradual emergence of new concepts that amount to the idea that there is something like an interiority and that this interiority — a kind of inner landscape — is where a single, self-identical “I” is located.</p><p>Now, what is crucial, is that the introduction of writing, which probably began right at the time of Homer, was key for the emergence of a <em>conceptual vocabulary</em> of interiority.</p><p>Snell touches on this only in passing, but later works, especially by Jack Goody, Eric Havelock and Walter Ong, have attended to this explicitly and all have more or less come to the same conclusion: The practice of writing created new possibilities for analytical thinking that led to increasingly abstract, classificatory nouns and to a form of systematic search and production of knowledge that was not seen anywhere in human history before.</p><p>These authors also made clear that the only unfortunate thing about Snell’s work is his use of the term “discovery” in his title. The mind was not discovered. It was constituted, invented, if you will. That is, it could have been constituted differently. And that is what Goody, Ong and others have amply shown. What mind is, what interiority is, is different in other places.</p><p>Let me summarize this simply by saying that the technology of writing had absolutely dramatic consequences for what it is to be human, for how we experience and understand ourselves as humans. Among the two, perhaps, most important of these consequences was <em>the systematic emergence of self-reflection and abstract thought.</em></p><p>Can AI play as transformative a role in what it means to be human as it did for writing?</p><p>Can AI mark the beginning of a whole new, perhaps radically discontinuous chapter for what it is to have a mind, to have interiority, to think? Can it help us think thoughts that are so new and so different that however we understood ourselves up until now become obsolete?</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “Can AI mark the beginning of a whole new, perhaps radically discontinuous chapter for what it is to have a mind, to have interiority, to think?”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>Oh yes, it can! AI absolutely has the potential to be such a major philosophical event.</p><p>The perhaps most beautiful, most fascinating and eye-opening way to show this potential of AI is what engineers call “latent space representations.”</p><p>When a large language model learns, it gradually distills ever more abstract logical principles from the data it is provided with.</p><p>It is best to think of this process as roughly similar to a structuralist analysis: The AI identifies the logical structure that organizes — that literally underlies — the totality of the data it is trained on and stores or memorizes it in the form of concepts. The way it does this is that it discovers the logic of the relations between different elements of the data. So, in text, roughly, that would be the words: What is the closeness between the different words in the training data?</p><p>If you will, an LLM discovers the many different degrees of relations between words.\n          </p>\n        <p>Fascinatingly, what emerges from this learning process is a high-dimensional, relational space that engineers call latent — in the sense of hidden — space.</p><p>First, this means that something grows on the inside of an LLM during training. A hidden map of the logic of relations between words that the AI successively discovers. I say on the inside because we humans cannot observe this map from the outside.</p><p>The second thing it means is that this map is not just a list but a spatial arrangement.</p><p>Imagine a three-dimensional point cloud where each point stands for a word and where the distance between points reflects how close or far words are from one another in the training data.</p><p>It is just, and this is the third thing, that this spatial map doesn’t have only the three dimensions — length, width, depth — our conscious human mind is comfortable operating in. Instead, it has many, many more dimensions. Tens of thousands and with the latest models, perhaps millions.</p><p>That is, the understanding an LLM has formed is a spatial architecture. It has a geometry that literally determines what, for an LLM, is thinkable.</p><p>It is literally the logical condition of possibility — the a priori — of the LLM.</p><p>For all we know, human brains also create latent space representations. The neurons in our brain work in a very similar fashion to how neurons work in a neural network.</p><p>Yet, despite this similarity, it appears that the latent space representations that a human brain produces and the latent space representations that an AI <em>can</em> produce are different from one another.</p><p>The two latent space representations likely overlap but they also differ significantly in kind and quality because of AI’s far greater dimensional scope.</p><p>Now imagine we could build AI so that the logic of possibility that defines the human brain gets extra latent spaces.</p><p>Imagine we built AI to add to our human mind logical spaces of possibility that we humans could travel but not produce on our own. The consequence would be that we humans could discover truths and think things that no human could have ever thought before AI. In this case, no one knows where the human mind might end and AI might begin.</p><p>We could take any theme and approach it from whole new perspectives. Imagine what this kind of co-cogitation between humans and AI would do to our current concept of interiority! Can you imagine what it would do to how we understand terms like mind, thought, having an idea or being creative?</p><p>As I outline this vision, I can hear the critical voices. They tell me that I make AI sound like a philosophical project while the companies building AI have very different motives.</p><p>I am entirely aware that I am giving AI philosophical and poetic dignity. And I do so consciously because I think AI has the potential to be an extraordinary philosophical event. It is our task as philosophers, artists, poets, writers and humanists to render this potential visible and relevant.</p><p>All this certainly has the makings of a new pivotal age.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>To grasp how deep learning through what AI scientists call backpropagation — the feeding of new information through the artificial neural networks of logical structures — could lead to interiority and intention, it might be useful to look at an analogy from the materialist view of biology about how consciousness arises. The core issue here is whether disembodied intelligence can mimic embodied intelligence through deep learning.</p><p>Where does AI depart from, and where is it similar to the neural Darwinism described here by Gerald Edelman, the Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist? What Edelman refers to as “reentrant interaction” appears quite similar to “backpropagation.”</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “Imagine we built AI to add to our human mind logical spaces of possibility that we humans could travel but not produce on our own.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>According to Edelman, “Competition for advantage in the environment enhances the spread and strength of certain synapses, or neural connections, according to the ‘value’ previously decided by evolutionary survival. The amount of variance in this neural circuitry is very large. Certain circuits get selected over others because they fit better with whatever is being presented by the environment. In response to an enormously complex constellation of signals, the system is self-organizing according to Darwin’s population principle. It is the activity of this vast web of networks that entails consciousness by means of what we call ‘reentrant interactions’ that help to organize ‘reality’ into patterns.</p><p>The thalamocortical networks were selected during evolution because they provided humans with the ability to make higher-order discriminations and adapt in a superior way to their environment. Such higher-order discriminations confer the ability to imagine the future, to explicitly recall the past and to be conscious of being conscious.</p><p>Because each loop reaches closure by completing its circuit through the varying paths from the thalamus to the cortex and back, the brain can ‘fill in’ and provide knowledge beyond that which you immediately hear, see or smell. The resulting discriminations are known in philosophy as qualia. These discriminations account for the intangible awareness of mood, and they define the greenness of green and the warmness of warmth. Together, qualia make up what we call consciousness.”</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>There are neural processes happening in AI systems that are similar — but not the same — as in humans.</p><p>It seems likely that there is some form of backpropagation in the brain. And we just talked about the fact that both biological neural networks and artificial neural networks build latent space representations. And there is more.</p><p>But I do not think that makes them have interiority or intentionality in the way we have come to understand these terms.</p><p>In fact, I think the philosophical significance of AI is that it invites us to reconsider the way we previously understood these terms.</p><p>And the close connection between backpropagation and reentry that you observe is a great example of that.</p><p>The person who did perhaps more than anyone to make the concepts of backpropagation accessible and widely known was David Rumelhart, a very influential psychologist and cognitive scientist who, like Edelman, lived and worked in San Diego.</p><p>Both Rumelhart and Edelman were key people in the <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/\">connectionism school</a>. I say this because I think the theoretical impulse between reentry and backpropagation is almost identical: the effort to develop a conceptual vocabulary that allows us to undifferentiate the biological and artificial neural networks in order to understand the brain better and in order to build better neural networks.</p><p>Some have suggested that the work of the connectionists was an attempt to think about the brain in terms of computers –– but one could just as well say it was an attempt to think about computers or AI in terms of biology.</p><p>At base, what matters was the invention of a vocabulary that didn’t need to make distinctions.</p><p>There is a space in the middle, an overlap.</p><p>It is very difficult to overemphasize how powerful this kind of conceptual work has been over the last 40 years.</p><p>Arguably, the work of people like Rumelhart and Edelman has led to a concept of intelligence that can be described in a substrate-independent manner. And these concepts are not just theoretical concepts but concrete engineering possibilities.</p><p>Does this mean that human brains and AI are the same thing?</p><p>Of course not. Are birds, planes and drones all the same thing? No, but they all make use of the general laws of aerodynamics. And the same may be true for brains. The material infrastructure of intelligence is very different — but some of the principles that organize these infrastructures may be very similar.</p><p>In some instances, we likely will want to build AI systems similar to human brains. But in many cases, I presume, we do not. What makes AI attractive, in my thinking, is that we can build intelligent systems that do not yet exist — but that are perfectly possible.</p><p>I often think of AI as a kind of very early-stage experimental embryology. Indeed, I often think that AI is doing for intelligence what synthetic biology did for nature. Meaning, synthetic biology transformed nature into a vast field of possibility. The number of things that exist in nature is minuscule compared to the things that could exist in nature. In fact, many more things have existed in the course of evolution than there are now, and there is no reason why we can’t combine strands of DNA and make new things. Synthetic biology is the field of practice that can bring these possible things into existence.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “What makes AI attractive, in my thinking, is that we can build intelligent systems that do not yet exist — but that are perfectly possible.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>The same is true for AI and intelligence. Today, intelligence is no longer defined by a single or a few instances of existing intelligences but by the very many intelligent things that could exist.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>Back in the 1930s, much of philosophy from Heidegger to Carl Schmitt was against an emergent technological system that alienated humans from “being.” As Schmitt put it back then, “technical thinking is foreign to all social traditions; the machine has no tradition. One of Karl Marx’s seminal sociological discoveries is that technology is the true revolutionary principle, besides which all revolutions based on natural law are antiquated forms of recreation. A society built exclusively on progressive technology would thus be nothing but revolutionary; it would soon destroy itself and its technology.” As Marx put it, “all that is solid melts into air.”</p><p>Does the nature of AI make Schmitt’s perspective obsolete, or is it simply a fulfillment of his perspective?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>I think the answer — and I take that to be very good news — is yes, it makes Schmitt’s perspective obsolete.</p><p>Let me first say something about Schmitt. He was essentially apocalyptic in his thinking.</p><p>Like all apocalyptic thinkers, he had a more or less definite, ontological and in his case also religious, worldview. Everything in his world had a definite, metaphysical meaning. And he thought the modern, liberal world, the world of the Enlightenment, was out there to destroy the timeless, ultimately, divine order of things. What is more, he thought that when this happened, all hell would break loose, and the end of the world would begin to unfold.</p><p>The lines that you quote illustrate this. On the one hand the modern, Enlightenment period, the factory, technology, substanceless, the relativizing quality of money, etc. — and, on the other hand, social, that is, racially defined national traditions, images and symbols.</p><p>Schmitt was worried that the liberal order would de-substantize the world. Everything would become relative. And at least if we go by his writings, he thought that Jews were one of the key driving forces of this de-substantification of the world. Famously, Schmitt was a rabid antisemite.</p><p>He was so worried about the end of the world that he aligned himself with Hitler and the Nazis and their agendas.</p><p>From today’s perspective, of course, it is obvious that the ones who embraced modern technology to de-substantize humans, to deprive them of their humanity and to murder them on an industrial scale, were the Nazis.</p><p>It is difficult to suppress a comment on Heidegger here, who sought to “defend being against technology.” That said, I think there are important differences between the two.</p><p>But let me go to the second part of my reply, why I think AI renders his world obsolete.</p><p>AI has proven that the either-or logic at the core of Schmitt’s thinking doesn’t hold. One example of this is provided by Schmitt’s curious appropriation of Marx.</p><p>Famously, Marx described the rise of industry enabled by the combustion engine as a dehumanizing event. Before capitalists discovered how they could use the combustion engine to fabricate goods, most goods were made in artisanal sweatshops. Maybe these sweatshops were harsh places. But, or so Marx suggests, they were also places of human dignity and virtuosity.</p><p>Why? Well, because at the center of these sweatshops were humans who used tools. As Marx saw it, tools are nothing in themselves. What one can do with a tool depends entirely on the imagination and the virtuosity of the human who uses it.</p><p>With the combustion engine, everything changed. It gave rise to factories in which goods were made by machines rather than by artisans. However, the machines were not entirely autonomous. They needed humans to assist them. That is, what the machines needed were not artisans. What they needed was not human imagination and virtuosity. On the contrary, what was needed were humans that could function as extensions of the machine. That made these humans mindless and reduced them to mere machines.</p><p>That is why Marx described the machine as the “other” of the human and the factory as the place where humans are deprived of their own humanity.</p><p>Schmitt appropriated this for his own argument to juxtapose his kind of substance thinking with the modern, technical world. The net outcome is that you now have a juxtaposition timeless, substantive, metaphysical truth on the one hand — and, on the other, the modern world of machines, of technology, of functionality, of relativity of values, of substance-less humans.</p><p>Hence, technology, for Schmitt, comes into view as an unnatural violence against the metaphysically timeless and true.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “The alternative to being against AI is to enter AI and try to show what it could be.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>Schmitt’s distinction was most certainly not timeless but intrinsic to the modern period and deeply indebted to its paradigm of the new machine versus the old human.</p><p>The deep-learning-based AI systems we have today defy and escape the “either-or” distinction of Schmitt — or of Marx and of Heidegger and all those who come after them.</p><p>AI clearly and beautifully shows us that there is a whole world in between these distinctions. A world of things, of which AI is just one, that have some qualities of intelligence and some qualities of machine — and that are reducible to neither. Things that are at once natural and built.</p><p>AI invites us to rethink ourselves and the world from within this in-between.</p><p>Let me say that I understand the wish to render human life meaningful. To render thought and intellectual insight critical and, so too, art, creativity, discovery, science and community. I totally get it and share it.</p><p>But I think the suggestion that all these things are on the one side, and AI and those who build it are on the other, is somewhat surprising and unfortunate.</p><p>A critical ethos grounded in this distinction reproduces the world it says it is against.</p><p>The alternative to being against AI is to enter AI and try to show what it could be.

In-Betweenness &amp; Symbiogenesis</strong></h2><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>I’m wondering if there is a correspondence between your “in-betweenness” point and Blaise Agüeras y Arcas’ idea that evolution advances not only by natural selection but through “symbiogenesis” — the mutual transformation that conjoins separate entities into one interdependent organism through the transfer of new information, for example, DNA fragments carried by bacteria that are “copy and pasted” into the cells they penetrate. What results is not either/or, but something new created by symbiosis.</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>I believe Blaise, like me, was influenced by an <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html\">essay</a> the American computer scientist <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider\">Joseph Licklider</a> published in 1960, called, called “Man-Computer Symbiosis.”</p><p>This is how the essay begins:</p><p>“The fig tree is pollinated only by the insect <em>Blastophaga grossorun</em>. The larva of the insect lives in the ovary of the fig tree, and there it gets its food. The tree and the insect are thus heavily interdependent: the tree cannot reproduce without the insect; the insect cannot eat without the tree; together, they constitute not only a viable but a productive and thriving partnership. This cooperative ‘living together in intimate association, or even close union, of two dissimilar organisms’ is called ‘symbiosis.’”</p><p>Licklider goes on: “At present (…) there are no man-computer symbioses. The purposes of this paper are to present the concept and, hopefully, to foster the development of man-computer symbiosis by analyzing some problems of interaction between men and computing machines, calling attention to applicable principles of man-machine engineering, and pointing out a few questions to which research answers are needed. The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.”</p><p>What does symbiosis mean? It means that one organism cannot survive without the other, which belongs to a different species. More specifically, it means that one organism is dependent on functions performed by the other organism. More philosophically put, symbiosis means that there is an indistinguishability in the middle. An impossibility to say where one organism ends and the other (or the others) begin.</p><p>Is it conceivable that this kind of interdependence will in the future occur between humans and AI?</p><p>The traditional answer is: Absolutely not. The old belief is that humans belong to nature and, more specifically, to biology, to living things that can self-reproduce. Computers, on the other hand, belong to a totally different ontological category, the category of artificial, the merely technical. They don’t grow, they are constructed and built. They have neither life nor being.</p><p>Symbiosis, in that old way of thinking, is only possible within the realm of nature, between living things. In this way of thinking, there cannot possibly be a human-computer symbiosis.</p><p>I think there was also a sense that what Licklider meant was an enrolling of humans into the machine concept. Perhaps like a cyborg. And as humans are supposedly more than or different from machines, that would mean a loss of that which makes us human, of that which sets us apart from machines.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “AI can have agency, creativity, knowledge, language and understanding without either being alive or being human.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>But as we have discussed, AI renders this old, classical modern distinction between living humans or beings and inanimate machines or things, insufficient.</p><p>AI leads us into a territory that lies outside of these old distinctions. If one enters this territory, one can see that things –– things like AI –– can have agency, creativity, knowledge, language and understanding without either being alive or being human.</p><p>That is, AI affords us with an opportunity to experience the world anew and to rethink how we have thus far organized things in the world, the categories to which we assigned them.</p><p>But here is the question: Is human-AI symbiosis possible from within this new, still emergent territory — this in-between territory — in the sense of the indistinguishability just described?</p><p>I think so. And I am excited about it. A bit like Licklider, I am looking forward to a “partnership” that will allow us to “think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.”</p><p>When we can think thoughts we cannot think without AI, and when AI can process data in ways it cannot on its own, then no one can say where humans end and AI begins. Then we have indistinguishability, a symbiosis.</p><p>Let me add that what I describe here — with Licklider — is not a gradual human dependency on AI, where we outsource all thinking and decision-making to AI until we are barely able to think or decide on our own.</p><p>Quite the opposite. I am describing a situation of maximal human intellectual curiosity. A state where being human is being more than human. Where the cognitive boundary between humans and AI becomes meaningfully indistinct.</p><p>Is this different, in an ontologically meaningful way, from fungi-tree relationships?</p><p>Their relationship is essentially a communication, in which they cogitate together. Neither party can produce or process the information exchanged in this communication alone. The actual processing of the information — cognition — happens at the interface between them: Call it symbiosis.</p><p>What, if any, is the ontological difference between human-AI symbiosis? I fail to see one.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>Perhaps such a symbiosis of inorganic and organic intelligence will spawn what Benjamin Bratton calls “planetary sapience,” where AI helps us better understand natural systems and align with them?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>What if we linked AI to this fungi-tree symbiosis? AI could read and translate chemical and electrical signals from fungi-tree-soil networks. These signals contain information about ecosystem health, nutrient flows, stress responses. That is, AI could make the communication between fungi-trees intelligible to humans in real-time.</p><p>We humans could then understand something — and possibly pose questions and thereby communicate — that we simply couldn’t otherwise, independent of AI. And simultaneously we can help AI ask the right questions and process information in ways it cannot on its own.</p><p>Now let’s expand the scope: What if AI could connect us to large-scale planetary systems that are impossible to know without AI? In fact, what if AI would become something like a self-monitoring planetary system into which we are directly looped. As Bratton has put it, “Only when intelligence becomes artificial and can be scaled into massive, distributed systems beyond the narrow confines of biological organisms, can we have a knowledge of the planetary systems in which we live.”</p><p>Perhaps in a way where — as DNA is the best storage for information we know — part of the information storage and the compute the AI relies on is actually done by mycorrhizal networks?</p><p>If anything, I can’t wait to have such a whole Earth symbiotic state — and to be a part of this form of reciprocal communication.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>What is the first next step to guiding us toward symbiosis between humans and intelligent machines that opens up the possibilities of AI augmenting the human experience as never before?<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>Ours is a time when philosophical research really matters. I mean, really, really matters.</p><p>As we have elaborated in this conversation, we live in philosophically discontinuous times. The world has been outgrowing the concepts we have lived by for some time now.</p><p>To some, that is very exciting. To many, however, it is not. The insecurity and confusion are widespread and real.</p><p>If history is any guide, we can assume that political unrest will occur, with possibly far-reaching consequences, including autocratic strongmen who try to enforce clinging to the past.</p><p>One way to prevent such unfortunate outcomes is to do the philosophical work that can lead to new concepts that allow us all to navigate uncharted pathways.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “AI could make the communication between fungi-trees intelligible to humans in real-time.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>However, the kind of philosophical work that is needed cannot be done in the solitude of ivory towers. We need philosophers in the wild, in AI labs and companies. We need philosophers who can work alongside engineers to jointly discover new ways of thinking and experiencing that might be afforded to us by AI.</p><p>What I dream of are philosophical R&amp;D labs that can experiment at the intersection of philosophical conceptual research, AI engineering and product making.</p><p><strong>Gardels: </strong>Can you give a concrete example?</p><p><strong>Rees: </strong>I think we live in unprecedented times, so giving an example is difficult. However, there is an important historical reference, the Bauhaus School.</p><p>When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus, in 1919, many German intellectuals were deeply skeptical of the industrial age. Not so Gropius. He experienced the possibilities that new materials like glass, steel and concrete offered as a conceptual rupture with the 19th century.</p><p>And so, he argued –– very much against the dominant opinion — that it was the duty of architects and artists to explore these new materials, and to invent forms and products that would lift people out of the 19th and into the 20th century.</p><p>Today, we need something akin to the Bauhaus — but focused on AI.</p><p>We need philosophical R&amp;D labs that would allow us to explore and practice AI as the experimental philosophy it is.</p><p>Billions are being poured into many different aspects of AI but very little into the kind of philosophical work that can help us discover and invent new concepts — new vocabularies for being human — in the world today. The Antikythera project of the Berggruen Institute under the leadership of Bratton is one small exception.</p><p>Philosophical R&amp;D labs will not happen automatically. There will be no new guiding philosophies or philosophical ideas if we do not make strategic investments.</p><p>In the absence of new concepts, people — the public as much as engineers — will continue to understand the new in terms of the old. As this doesn’t work, there will be decades of turmoil.</p>\n          \n        \n      </div></div>",

She had braced herself for piercings and purple hair, questionable friend choices and what she might say if she found drugs in any pockets. Not that her teenage son had raised any major concerns. Abie Rohrig was shy and kind, the sort of kid teachers describe as a delight to have in class. Abie had big ideas and the ambition to go after them.</p><p>So when Abie came home from school in 2017 and announced that he wanted to donate a kidney to a stranger, the 17-year-old’s pronouncement took his normally even-keeled mother off-guard.</p><p>“I’m donating my kidney to a stranger,” Abie told her.</p><p>While Perlman was tickled by her son’s altruism, she couldn’t stop her Mom Brain from kicking into overdrive. <em>Wasn’t the surgery dangerous? Didn’t Abie need both kidneys? What would happen decades from now? And what could possibly motivate someone to undergo major surgery for a complete stranger?</em></p><p>Since 2000, the number of living organ donors in the U.S. has remained <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/news/continued-increase-in-organ-donation-drives-new-records-in-2023-new-milestones-exceeded\">relatively stagnant</a> at around 6,000 to 6,500 annually, even as the kidney transplant waitlist has grown to nearly 100,000 in that same time. Most of these donors give to family or friends — only <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/professionals/by-topic/ethical-considerations/living-non-directed-organ-donation/#:~:text=KIDNEY:%20Non%2Ddirected%20donors%20totaled,years%202010%20through%20June%202015\">around 3%</a> of living donations are undirected and go to total strangers.</p><p>What makes kidneys from living donors especially valuable is that these organs generally last several years longer than a cadaver kidney. The shortage of available kidneys is intensified by the complexities of finding a donor with a compatible immune system profile to reduce the chances of rejection.</p><p>Although the actual surgery is generally safe and commonplace, would-be kidney donors also face a range of barriers and requirements, depending on the transplant centers. Many are medical; anything less than A+ health is disqualifying, Rosamond Rhodes, a bioethicist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, told me. Across the board, it’s clear: You must be in good mental and physical health. Other barriers are practical. Donors must take time off work for testing, surgery and recovery. They need transportation to and from the hospital. Then there are incidentals like food and parking. It all adds up. These hurdles may explain why only 300 to 400 Americans each year donate a kidney to a stranger, Perlman said.</p><p>Her son’s experience donating a kidney at New York City’s NYU Langone hospital in 2019 led Perlman to do the same six months later. As she learned more about America’s — and the world’s — kidney shortage, she began to champion an idea that some in the medical community find morally repugnant: compensating living kidney donors for their act.</p><p>Perlman has been the driving force behind a bill called the “<a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9275\">End Kidney Deaths Act</a>,” which was introduced to the House by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in late summer 2024 and would primarily provide tax breaks as a form of compensation to individuals who gave undirected living kidney donors. The amount, $50,000 over five years, is meant to not only allow donors to recoup lost wages but also as a token of appreciation for a selfless act, Perlman said. Economists arrived at the number through a series of studies that worked to balance the money saved through a transplant rather than ongoing dialysis treatment, public opinion on the value of kidneys from living donors, and a monetary amount persuasive enough to incentivize potential donors to step up to the plate.</p><p>“Donation, I recognize very clearly, is work. It’s time consuming, it’s painful, it’s stressful work. If you just compensate people for what they’ve done, you will have a far greater impact,” Perlman told me.</p><p>Economically speaking, Frank McCormick, a retired economist and former director of economic and financial research at Bank of America, told me the proposal is a slam dunk. Ethically, however, not everyone is convinced. A prohibition against selling organs has been a medical mainstay for decades. Dr. Gabriel Danovitch, the now-retired director of the University of California, Los Angeles’ Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program, sees donor compensation as a slippery slope to back-alley surgeries and black-market organ auctions. And when so much money is on the line, will patients be as honest about their medical histories with the transplant team?</p><p>“If you’re donating a kidney to someone you care about, you’re going to tell the truth,” Danovitch said. “But if you’re doing it because you need some money, well, why would you necessarily?”</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      Kidney donation is “time consuming, it’s painful, it’s stressful work. If you just compensate people for what they’ve done, you will have a far greater impact.”    </p>\n\n          \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>Danovitch’s revulsion at the idea of potential patient coercion and organ trafficking is shared by everyone in the transplant world. But the End Kidney Deaths Act isn’t setting up some sort of Silk Road for kidneys, McCormick told me. Instead, providing tax breaks for donors shows that society values what they do. It’s no different than paying doctors and nurses their salaries for performing the transplant.</p><p>“This is a shortage that is killing people,” McCormick said. “More than <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6287861/#:~:text=However%2C%20if%20only%2020%2C000%20patients,loaded%20747s%20crashing%20each%20year.\">40,000 people</a> each year are suffering on dialysis unnecessarily and dying prematurely.”</p><p>Whether the bill will pass under the new administration remains to be seen, but if it became law, the U.S. would join the ranks of only a few other countries — Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel — that permit payments to living donors. It’s a bold step, as well as one fraught with ethical complications.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"h-anatomy-of-a-transplant\"><strong>Anatomy Of A Transplant</strong></h2><p>Ever since Dr. Joseph Murray removed Ronald Herrick’s kidney and placed it into the abdomen of his 23-year-old identical twin brother, Richard, in 1954, organ transplants have been saving lives. The development of immunosuppressant medications such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus opened the world of transplant to others, beyond identical twins. This lifesaving achievement had limitations, however, as the number of individuals needing a transplant has always outstripped the number of organs available.</p><p>What makes kidney transplants different, Perlman told me, is that living people can donate with no long-term ill effects. Our kidneys filter toxins from our blood, yes, but they also ensure the correct balance of water, electrolytes, salts and essential minerals in our bodies. They’re so <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/kidneys-how-they-work\">vital</a> that our kidneys have far more capacity than we really need. Many of those born with unilateral renal agenesis — a rare condition where a person only develops a single kidney — never even know they have it. A single kidney, then, is generally adequate for normal physical functioning.&nbsp; It’s not until kidney function drops dangerously low to about 15% that individuals develop serious symptoms of kidney failure.&nbsp;</p><p>But just because someone has excess kidney capacity doesn’t mean they’re a candidate to relinquish their spare parts. Common conditions such as diabetes and hypertension are a leading cause of kidney failure, which rules out many would-be donors. Heart disease, cancer and obesity can all exclude donors. Even high risk of developing these conditions in the future is enough to keep someone from donating. If the rules sound stringent, that’s because they are, Dr. Arthur Matas, a transplant surgeon at the University of Minnesota Medical School, told me.</p><p>“In order to be a kidney donor, you need to essentially be perfectly healthy with no chronic diseases, except maybe something like acne or asthma,” he said.</p><p>Physicians like Matas helped craft these rules over the decades to protect donors from unforeseen health consequences down the road. Should an unforeseen health crisis occur, these donors are <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/22/living-organ-donors-priority-status-transplant-waiting-list/#:~:text=Under%20the%20current%20UNOS%20allocation,prior%20living%20donors%20like%20me.\">typically</a> placed at the top of the transplant list.</p><p>“You’re taking somebody to the operating room who doesn’t need an operation for their own physical benefit, so you want to do absolutely everything to minimize risk,” Matas said. <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9747133/\">Long-term studies</a> show that living kidney donors show minimal increased risk for future disease even decades after their kidney was removed. Donor screening was rigorous enough to ensure that the donors were unlikely to develop conditions that would have a detrimental impact on their remaining kidney function.</p><p>The other challenge for physicians is ensuring the new kidney isn’t rejected by the recipient’s immune system. All our cells are studded with sugary proteins called human leukocyte antigens that act as molecular “Hello My Name is” stickers that our immune system reads to determine if the cell it encounters is from our own body or a pathogen. Our name tags are controlled by genetics, which means that a parent, child or sibling is much more likely to have a cell signature similar to our own (only identical twins would have virtually the same molecular name tags on their cells). If patrolling immune cells stumble upon a name tag that isn’t ours, they will attack the intruder.</p><p>Immunosuppressant medications can dampen this response, but they can’t eliminate it. A donor kidney with a more familiar name tag is crucial for the organ to last long term. Without an adequate match, even a kidney from an exceptionally healthy and willing donor isn’t of much use.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “If you’re donating a kidney to someone you care about, you’re going to tell the truth. But if you’re doing it because you need some money, well, why would you necessarily?”    </p>\n\n          \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>In the early 2000s, Stanford economist Alvin Roth realized that <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://new.nsf.gov/news/kidney-exchange-life-saving-application-matching#:~:text=In%20September%202004%2C%20the%20Renal,hospitals%20to%20arrange%20kidney%20exchanges\">matching</a> a donor kidney to its recipient wasn’t just a medical question, it was an economic one. Instead of sending a donor-recipient pair away because of an immunological mismatch, Roth helped develop a system of kidney exchanges. This allows recipients with incompatible donors to swap kidneys to create the ultimate win-win scenario. It goes something like this: say Wife A wants to donate to Husband B, and Father C wants to donate to Daughter D, but neither is a good match. Instead, Wife A donates to Daughter D and Father C donates to Husband B — both better matches here — and everyone wins.</p><p>“You’re looking for combinations that yield lots of good transplants,” Roth said.</p><p>The strategy seemed like such an obvious solution, Roth told me, but it took an act of Congress to make the idea legal. The 1984 National Organ Transplant Act (<a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/2048/text\">NOTA</a>) established the framework of the modern American transplant system. It also included a provision that prohibited any exchange of “valuable consideration” for a human organ for transplantation. This terminology made it illegal to buy or sell human organs. What no one could answer with any certainty was whether a kidney donation chain counted as valuable consideration, since the organs were exchanged outside of strict donor-recipient pairs. It wasn’t until 2007 that Congress officially <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/710\">amended</a> NOTA to allow for donation chains. <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.uab.edu/news/health/item/9638-nation-s-longest-single-site-kidney-chain-reaches-100\">The longest of these chains</a> at a single site started in 2013 and currently spans over 100 people at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p><p>Even the Nobel Prize committee agreed with the importance of donation chains, <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/summary/\">awarding</a> Roth and Lloyd Shapley the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences “for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.” But Roth’s idea hasn’t made much of a dent in the transplant waitlist.</p><p>“We do more than 1,000 kidney exchange transplants a year in the United States now. That’s a good thing, but it’s not enough to end the shortage of kidneys,” Roth said.</p><p>Some in the transplant community saw the ongoing problem as one of economics, in which demand far outstripped supply. To people like McCormick, the solution was simple: pay people to donate their kidneys.</p><p>As someone who has browsed both eBay and Facebook Marketplace, I have seen people put a price tag on pretty much everything. Everything from dusty yearbooks and Beanie Babies to antique vases and endangered turtles (despite prohibitive rules) can be bought and sold with the click of a button. The prices of such items are often governed by the elusive laws of supply and demand. A high-demand, low-supply item, such as an original Picasso, commands staggering prices. The inverse — a low-demand and high-supply item— causes the value to plummet (as evidenced by the job offers received by myself and other freelance writers).</p><p>McCormick learned these rules in Econ 101 and taught them to subsequent generations as a guest lecturer. The law of supply and demand, however, comes with a caveat: it only applies to an open market. Since the government forbids the sale of kidneys for transplant, it’s not an open market. As an economist for the Bank of America, he didn’t think much about how supply and demand applied to kidneys. McCormick didn’t even think they should be bought and sold. But as he prepared his lecture notes on price ceilings for an introductory economics lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, he asked a friend for examples that might be more relevant to younger students than 1970s price controls on gasoline. His friend asked, “What about kidneys?”&nbsp;</p><p>Banning the sale of an item, be it a can of kidney beans or an entire functional kidney, imposes a price ceiling of $0. Everything fell into place in McCormick’s head with a sudden <em>thunk</em>. Kidneys were scarce because there was no market to buy and sell them. Create a market and you could reduce that deficit.&nbsp;\n          </p>\n        <p>“There’s a market for kidneys, just like there’s a market for everything else,” McCormick said. “Supply and demand apply to kidneys as well as everything else. And if you fool around and hold the price down, you’re asking for trouble, and trouble is what we have in spades.”</p><p>According to the rules of economics, then, McCormick reasoned, the most efficient way to increase kidney transplants is by simply paying donors. But to others in the transplant community, the issue was moral and medical, not economic. The world needs more organ donors, yes, but they argue that the solution isn’t to put a price tag on kidneys.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “Kidneys were scarce because there was no market to buy and sell them. Create a market and you could reduce that deficit.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><h2 id=\"h-navigating-potential-pitfalls\"><strong>Navigating Potential Pitfalls</strong></h2><p>From an engineering standpoint, the kidneys are a physiological marvel. Even the world’s most advanced dialysis machines only recapture a portion of the kidney’s biological activity. The complexity of the fist-sized organs — along with the life-threatening complications when they fail — never ceases to amaze Danovitch. As a UCLA nephrologist, he helped hundreds of patients receive new kidneys and watched hundreds more die while waiting for a transplant. But Danovitch <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39688370/\">draws the line</a> at compensating donors.</p><p>“It’s payment. It’s money,” he told me. “And it’s a disaster.”</p><p>Danovitch cites a laundry list of reasons why paying organ donors is fraught with moral hazard. In addition to incentivizing aspiring donors to conceal important and potentially disqualifying information, compensating donations solely to strangers could effectively strangle the far more common process of donating to a loved one. Why go through a painful surgery if you could just wait for someone else to donate for the $50k tax break? Most of all, the promise of payment is likely to be coercive; a person in desperate straits might do something they wouldn’t otherwise, just because they need the money. Danovitch cites <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/in-nepals-kidney-valley-poverty-drives-an-illegal-market-for-human-organs\">news reports</a> from around the world about impoverished people who sold a kidney to feed their families, keep a roof over their heads or pay for school. These potential downsides, paired with the urgent need for more donors, mean that physicians are constantly debating whether to compensate living donors.</p><p>“We’re always asking, ‘should we or shouldn’t we, should we or shouldn’t we,’ and the last thing we want is to say no because, after all, they’re going to be able to go to college now, or they’re going to make $50,000,” he said.</p><p>Our culture celebrates organ donors as heroes, Danovitch said, recalling a flight attendant’s look of joy when she told Danovitch of her own experience donating a kidney to a friend. When fellow passengers overheard what the flight attendant had done, they treated her to a round of applause.</p><p>“It’s like a halo effect,” Danovitch told me. Selling kidneys would change that.</p><p>All of which might be true. But many of us might prefer the $50k. Haloes, after all, don’t put gas in the car or food on the table. The fact that Danovitch got paid to perform transplant surgeries doesn’t make his efforts any less lifesaving, nor does it mean you can’t get the warm fuzzies inside from doing a worthwhile job, Matas, the transplant surgeon, noted.</p><p>Matas also argues that seemingly altruistic decisions such as donating a kidney to a friend or family member nonetheless have value to the donor. They might be able to enjoy more years with a spouse, child or friend. Just because the benefit isn’t monetary doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, he said.</p><p>Nor is it any of our concern how a potential paid donor might choose to spend their funds, Rhodes said. Maybe they want money for college or to pay for a cancer drug, or maybe to start a business or travel the world.&nbsp;</p><p>“People’s motivations are their own business,” Rhodes said. “I shouldn’t be the one to judge their acceptability.”</p><p>For Andreas Brøgger Albertsen, a philosopher and political scientist at Aarhus University in Denmark, the moral dilemma is more subtle. Why, he asked me, have we created a culture in which people feel that selling a kidney is the best economic option? This doesn’t mean that the U.S. shouldn’t modify NOTA, nor that it’s a bad idea. However, he said, there’s a danger in turning “donate a kidney” into a “get out of poverty” scheme.</p><p>“This proposal will interact with existing inequalities. Even though those inequalities might not preclude people from making an informed choice about whether they want to be organ donors, it could reflect sadly on the society, that this is what we do for people who don’t have means,” Albertsen said.</p><p>It’s hard to overcome the initial gut reaction that paying for a kidney somehow sullies the moral waters and taints an otherwise “pure” gift, Rhodes told me. The attitude lingers in the 2007 NOTA modification that officially okayed donation chains but not reimbursement for would-be donors. To Perlman and other activists, this attitude is a moral relic that claims <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5937230/\">as many as 4,500 American lives</a> on the transplant waiting list each year.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “There’s a danger in turning ‘donate a kidney’ into a ‘get out of poverty’ scheme.”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><h2 id=\"h-the-price-of-altruism\"><strong>The Price Of Altruism</strong></h2><p>That someone would volunteer for an invasive procedure they didn’t need, to part ways with a perfectly healthy organ, to donate to a stranger, wasn’t always seen as altruistic. Just a few decades ago, many thought it unhinged, Rhodes pointed out. Several years ago, Rhodes chaired a meeting of the Mount Sinai Hospital ethics board about non-directed kidney donation, she recalled. At the time, the hospital didn’t allow it because of concerns about the psychiatric health of potential donors. Nearly everyone agreed that the hospital shouldn’t allow these surgeries to proceed. Out of the corner, however, a committee member spoke up.</p><p>“There is that forest in Israel,” the physician began.</p><p>Mount Sinai’s long Jewish tradition meant that everyone in the room knew what he was referring to: the <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/about-the-righteous/garden-of-the-righteous.html\">trees</a> surrounding the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum that were planted in honor of those who risked their lives to help Jews during World War II.&nbsp;</p><p>“We honor them and think they are heroes. They were also seen as crazy people, and it was certainly more life-threatening than being a kidney donor,” Rhodes told me.&nbsp;</p><p>The comment hit home. When it came time to vote on Mount Sinai’s non-directed donation program, everyone in the room raised their hand, Rhodes recalled.</p><p>Once Perlman’s son, Abie, realized that he was walking around with an item that he didn’t technically need that could save another person’s life, he couldn’t be dissuaded from donating a kidney. Perlman was somewhat less-than-enthusiastic about her son’s choice.</p><p>But Abie’s well-researched response to his mom was worthy of a debate team. Humans are perfectly healthy with a single kidney, and the donation surgery is safer than everyday procedures like appendectomies and knee replacements. <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9747133/\">Long-term outcome studies</a> show that kidney donors are just as healthy as their non-donating counterparts. What’s more, 90,092 Americans are currently waiting for a kidney and 17 people die every day <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics\">waiting for a transplant</a>. His logic came down to this: donating a kidney will save a life and cause me no harm. “Why <em>wouldn’t</em> I donate a kidney?”</p><p>Perlman’s rebuttal — because it’s completely bonkers, that’s why — did little to sway Abie from his quest. At 18, the minimum age for organ donation, Abie Rohrig began the lengthy, rigorous process of medical testing.</p><p>But as Perlman continued researching the idea, she gradually became intrigued, then convinced. By the time Rohrig had cleared the medical hurdles, the surgery itself seemed a breeze. When Rohrig arrived home from the hospital a few days after the donation, Perlman had made up her mind. She, too, would donate her kidney to a stranger.</p><p>“We’ve got nearly 5,000 people a year <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5937230\">dying</a> on the waitlist. To me, that’s not ethical when it’s preventable,” Perlman said.</p><p>After Perlman joined the One Kidney Club (her nickname for living kidney donors that she bestowed upon an online support group), she began to meet others who had donated a kidney to strangers. All shared the same experience as she and her son: a relatively minor inconvenience for them that saved the life of another.&nbsp;</p><p>Perlman began to devote her efforts to enabling more people to donate to strangers. The barriers, she discovered, were surprisingly banal. Giving someone the ability to take time off work and pay for issues associated with the transplant surgery and its aftermath would clear problematic hurdles for many people, but what potential donors needed was cash.</p><p>Economists like McCormick had been contemplating this issue as well. While many researchers may have shied away from connecting a dollar figure with a functional kidney, McCormick has not. Part of McCormick’s challenge was a lack of precedent. Iran pays living kidney donors a small fixed sum of 10 million rials (about $240) as a reward, according to a <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9266983/\">2022 study</a>, although would-be donors <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1600613522262133\">can also negotiate</a> an additional, supplementary payment from recipients. <span>Saudi Arabia also&nbsp;<a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.scot.gov.sa/en/patients-organ-failuree\">compensates</a>&nbsp;kidney donors, providing 50,000 rials (just over $13,000) to donors, while Israel <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1600613522258687\">provides reimbursement</a> for expenses and lost wages that vary by patient and are based on income.</span> Cultural and economic differences between these countries, as well as the different methods used to compensate donors, limit comparisons.&nbsp;</p><p>A multitude of studies have shown that kidney transplants in the U.S. save both money and lives. <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1600613522006517\">Current estimates</a> place that per person dollar amount at $1.3 million in value for the recipient’s improved quality of life and lifespan, plus the $1.45 million in savings on medical care for the no longer necessary thrice-weekly dialysis appointments. A <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268122002839\">2022 paper</a> placed the market value for a healthy kidney from a living donor between $10,000 and $25,000.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      “Why have we created a culture in which people feel that selling a kidney is the best economic option?”    </p>\n\n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</figure><p>In a series of studies, McCormick and colleagues <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109830152201957X\">closed in on a figure</a> between $50,000 to $100,000, which would <a rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" href=\"https://journals.lww.com/JASN/fulltext/2019/08000/Removing_Disincentives_to_Kidney_Donation__A.5.aspx\">remove the financial disincentives</a> of kidney donation (as measured in lost wages and other variables), account for the value of the kidney itself, and also be large enough to spur an adequate number of donors. A system of tax breaks spread over five years would provide additional value to donors while also helping to prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage of the poor and desperate. Rather than simply cutting a check, the activists working to modify NOTA proposed tax breaks at $10,000 per year for five years. If someone didn’t pay $10,000 in federal taxes, they would receive the remainder of the funds as cash. The program would start as a 10-year pilot project, and Perlman said that, if successful, it could be made permanent.</p><p>The idea has had bipartisan support, but it has also remained in legislative limbo for the past six months, waiting to be shepherded through the process that introduces a bill and transforms it into a law. With a new Congress taking office, the process will need to begin again. While no one has yet proposed reintroducing it, supporters remain hopeful.</p><p>“This is a proposal that just says donors are really generous,” Roth said, “maybe we can be generous to them in return.”</p><p><em>Corrections: On Feb. 14, 2025, this story was corrected to reflect the fact that Iran is not the only country that allows payment for living donors —&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and Israel do as well.</em> <em>The story was also corrected to note that Dr. Gabriel Danovitch is a nephrologist, not a transplant surgeon.</em></p>\n          \n        \n      </div></div>",

Polacy bardzo nisko oceniają swoją sytuacje finansową i bardzo lubią mieszkania i domy, w których żyją. A statystyka Polski jeśli chodzi o warunki mieszkaniowe szoruje po europejskim dnie.

Z perspektywy historycznej patrząc, ekonomia była nauką o szczęściu. Ale to przecież takie niekonkretne pojęcie, subiektywne, uznaniowe. A ekonomiści zawsze chcieli być bardzo naukowi, ściśli, mieć silną metodę i pomiar. Więc zaczęliśmy od tego nieokreślonego szczęścia uciekać. Zamieniliśmy je sobie na użyteczność. Gdy otworzy pan pierwszy lepszy podręcznik ekonomiczny znajdzie pan tam dużo o użyteczności i nic o szczęściu.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Pojęciem, które robi ostatnio karierę jest też dobrostan. Wszędzie widzę to słowo.<br>\n</b><span>Tak i to jest również ucieczka w stronę konkretu. Dobrostan brzmi jak coś, co można sparametryzować, zmierzyć. A wykres o szczęściu będzie zawsze budził uśmiech politowania. Bo przecież każdy ma „swoje szczęście”. Nie sposób go zmierzyć.</span></p>\n<p><b>A co z dobrobytem? Przecież, jak wsłuchać się w to, co mówią nam media i politycy, to dość łatwo dojść do wniosku, że będziemy szczęśliwi tylko wówczas, gdy będziemy bardziej zamożni. Gdy zwiększy się nasz dobrobyt.<br>\n</b><span>I założę się, że obaj wyczuwamy fałsz tej odpowiedzi. Temu fałszowi służy właśnie wspomniana wcześniej użyteczność. Mówiąc w uproszczeniu - użyteczność służy bogaceniu się, a bogacenie się ma rzekomo sprzyjać szczęściu. W słowie „dobrobyt” zamyka się to uproszczenie.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n                    <div>\n            <blockquote>\n                <p>Simon Kuznets, ten, który PKB wymyślił, w liście do Kongresu Stanów Zjednoczonych pisał, że ten wskaźnik w żadnym wypadku nie powinien być używany do pomiaru jakości życia społeczeństwa\n</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n                    <div><p><strong>W raporcie z badania „Mieszkaniowe mieć czy być. Dobrostan mieszkańców Polski na styk finansów i miejsc zamieszkania”, w którego opracowaniu brał Pan udział, czytam, że nasze poczucie satysfakcji z życia rośnie wraz ze wzrostem zarobków tylko do pewnego poziomu, a potem bogacenie się już nam większego szczęścia nie daje. To plateau pojawia się na poziomie 7-10 tysięcy złotych dochodu.<br>\n</strong>Tak i nie jest to wiadomość dla nas zupełnie nowa. Wiemy to właściwie od pięćdziesięciu lat. Mało tego, w wielu przypadkach mamy do czynienia ze zjawiskami negatywnymi, których występowanie rośnie wraz ze wzrostem zamożności. Jednym z takich zjawisk jest depresja. To właśnie jest powód tego, że słowo dobrobyt trąci już nieco myszką, a PKB niczego w zasadzie nam nie objaśnia.</p>\n<p><strong>A to nie jest trochę schizofreniczne? Bo przecież wystarczy otworzyć jakikolwiek portal czy gazetę i tam będzie coś o PKB. Ciągle wierzymy w ten parametr.&nbsp;</strong><br>\nJest, nie wiem co miałbym tu jeszcze dodać. Simon Kuznets, ten, który PKB wymyślił, w liście do Kongresu Stanów Zjednoczonych pisał, że ten wskaźnik w żadnym wypadku nie powinien być używany do pomiaru jakości życia społeczeństwa. PKB mówi tylko o stanie gospodarki. Marnym pocieszeniem jest tu fakt, że nie jest to jedyny apel naukowca zignorowany przez polityków.</p>\n<p><strong>Myśli pan, że w końcu przestaniemy się ekscytować wzrostami albo spadkami PKB? Że politycy i ekonomiści przestaną nas tym karmić?</strong><br>\nNie mam złudzeń, zbyt prędko to się nie wydarzy. Trudno mi sobie wyobrazić, że jest polityk, który powie - zapomnijmy o PKB, o bogaceniu się, zadbajmy o relacje albo szeroko rozumianą duchowość. Przecież jesteśmy dziś w miejscu, w którym manipulujemy statystyką, tylko po to, by wzrost PKB wykazać. Ale też warto się przygotowywać mentalnie na nowy scenariusz. Epoka bez wzrostu majaczy nam na horyzoncie.</p>\n<p><strong>Jak to?<br>\n</strong>Niektórzy ekonomiści zauważają, że to na czym się opierał wzrost gospodarczy traci na znaczeniu. Wzrost gospodarczy zaczął się praktycznie wtedy, gdy pociągi wyjeżdżały na tory. Potem wzrost podtrzymywały elektryczność, telefony, samochody, samoloty ale też kanalizacja i klimatyzacja umożliwiająca nam pracę w gorące miesiące. Dalej czynnikiem wzrostu była edukacja, powojenny wzrost zatrudnienia kobiet, no i oczywiście konsumpcja. Dzisiaj to już nie działa: pokolenie baby boomers schodzi z rynku pracy, kobiety już pracują i za bardzo nie wiem kogo jeszcze moglibyśmy zaktywizować. A do tego mężczyźni, nawet ci w wieku produkcyjnym pracują rzadziej i mniej niż kiedyś.&nbsp; Studenci zaś drżą słysząc coraz częściej powtarzane słowo „nadmierne wykształcenie”, inflacja dyplomów i zerowa premia z wykształcenia.</p>\n</div>\n                    <div>\n            <blockquote>\n                <p>Napędzająca gospodarkę konsumpcja w wielu krajach bierze się z zadłużenia, które kiedyś trzeba będzie spłacić</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n                    <div><p>Tym co miało podtrzymać wzrost miały być komputery i internet – tak to pomogło, ale jak się oblicza tylko przez 8 lat, tymczasem maszyna parowa, pociągi i statki podtrzymywały wzrost gospodarczy przez 80 lat. Dziesięć razy dłużej. Dlatego coraz częściej słyszymy: może czas zacząć przyzwyczajać się do tego, że wzrostu gospodarczego nie będzie.</p>\n<p><strong>No dobrze, ale co z tym szczęściem vel dobrostanem? Bo ja nadal w gruncie rzeczy nie wiem, co pan mierzy.<br>\n</strong>Wracając do tradycji ekonomii moglibyśmy powiedzieć, że szczęście to tak naprawdę przyjemność, która jest odczuwana w trakcie wykonywania jakiejś czynności albo doświadczenia czegoś. Natomiast dzisiaj, kiedy mówimy o szczęściu, kiedy badamy szczęście, jest jeszcze drugie podejście, które jest bardzo powszechne i które mi również odpowiada. W tym ujęciu szczęście to jest satysfakcja z całości naszego życia. Tak między innymi opisywał szczęście profesor Władysław Tatarkiewicz. Takiego pomiaru satysfakcji dokonuje co roku Gallup na potrzeby raportu o szczęściu ONZ. Obok oceny swojego życia Instytut Gallupa, pyta też o emocje; o to na przykład czy w ostatnim tygodniu odczuwałeś szacunek, albo czy coś cię zaciekawiło, albo czy dowiedziałeś się czegoś interesującego. Albo odwrotnie, czy czułeś strach, ból, rozczarowanie. To badanie sprawdza nasz emocjonalny dobrostan. On ma przecież fundamentalny związek z naszym poczuciem szczęścia.</p>\n<p><strong>I gdy czyta pan później omówienia tych raportów w mediach, to co pana, jako badacza najbardziej irytuje?</strong><br>\nNajbardziej chyba akcentowanie, że to my sami jesteśmy odpowiedzialni za nasze szczęście. I że jak nam nie wychodzi, to jest to jest to nasza wina, bo przecież mamy taki wielki wybór, takie tyle różnych możliwości, które możemy realizować w życiu, a mimo wszystko ostatecznie i tak się okazuje, że nie jesteśmy zadowoleni.<br>\nDruga, niebezpieczna tendencja to sprowadzenie złożonych wyników takich badań, do rozumowania, że żeby być szczęśliwym, trzeba spełnić jakiś konkretny warunek albo pakiet warunków. Czyli, że na przykład jeżeli będę zamożny i zdrowy, to będę szczęśliwy.</p>\n<p><strong>To chyba naturalne, że szukamy takich związków przyczynowo - skutkowych?</strong></p>\n<p>Tak, ale one przecież mogą działać w dwie strony. Jak z tą relacją szczęścia i zamożności. Jeśli jestem szczęśliwy mogę być osobą, której łatwiej wykonuje się pracę, bez trudu nawiązuje relacje zawodowe, spotykam ludzi, myślę w otwarty sposób i znajduję optymalne rozwiązania dla problemów, co przekłada się na moje zarobki. I znowu: nie musi tak być, doskonale wiemy, że nie zawsze tak bywa. Ale warto spróbować spojrzeć na te badania szczęścia w taki właśnie sposób. I gdy się to zrobi, to zaczyna się rozumieć, że to nie działa na zasadzie prostej reguły - jeśli zrobię A, to na pewno wydarzy się B.</p>\n<p><strong>A my ciągle szukamy recepty na szczęście. Jest wręcz imperatyw bycia szczęśliwym. Sam osobiście traktuję to pojęcie agnostycznie, ale ilekroć o tym mówię w towarzystwie, to ktoś na mnie patrzy ze współczuciem. Bo ktoś, kto nie czuje potrzeby bycia szczęśliwym, z zasady jest postrzegany jako nieszczęśliwy.<br>\n</strong>Wie pan, ja się tym szczęściem od lat zajmuję zawodowo i jedno co wiem na pewno, to że trudno podjąć jakąkolwiek decyzję, o której da się jednoznacznie powiedzieć, że ona pomoże ludziom być szczęśliwymi. Ja bym się na to nie pisał, to jest potwornie złożone i nie wiemy jeszcze tak naprawdę jak bardzo. Sam bardzo rzadko pozwalam sobie na sformułowanie, że coś może sprzyjać szczęściu. Bo wiem, że może, ale wcale nie musi.</p>\n</div>\n                    <div>\n            <blockquote>\n                <p>Wydaje mi się ryzykownym kształtowanie polityki w taki sposób, żeby ona sprzyjała szczęściu\n</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n                    <div><p><strong>To czego pan oczekuje od polityków? Bo to jest chyba ich rola, żeby budować warunki dla szczęścia obywateli i obywatelek.</strong><br>\nGdy politycy zaczynają mówić o szczęściu, robię się podejrzliwy. Wolałbym, żeby mówili otwarcie o tym, że są dla naszej satysfakcji z życia rzeczy ważniejsze niż tylko gospodarka. Nie tylko ona wpływa na nasze życie. Ludzie są szczęśliwsi, jeżeli na przykład pracują krócej. Mało tego - są też wtedy bardziej produktywni. Nic nie stoi na przeszkodzie, żeby tego argumentu użyć w dyskusji na temat skracania czasu pracy. Ekonomiści jednak nader często uznają, że te badania o szczęściu są ciekawe, ale nie są tak naprawdę ważne.</p>\n<p><strong>Od początku tej rozmowy próbuje mnie pan przekonać że bogactwo, to nie wszystko, a ja otwieram ten raport o mieszkaniowym „mieć czy być” i tam jak wół stoi, że najbardziej zadowoleni z życia w Polsce są ci, którzy mają ponad sześćdziesiąt lat i właśnie spłacili swój kredyt mieszkaniowy. Są na swoim. A generalnie poziom zadowolenia tych, którzy posiadają mieszkanie jest zwykle wyższy od tych co wynajmują. To jak to jest?</strong><br>\nI obu rzeczy można było się spodziewać. Po pierwsze generalnie jest tak, że wykres pokazujący relację zadowolenia z życia i wieku badanych osób ma w większości badań, w różnych krajach i kontekstach kształt litery U. Po prostu najbardziej zadowoleni z życia jesteśmy w młodości i na starość. Najgorzej być w średnim wieku. Przed pięćdziesiątką albo w okolicach.</p>\n<p><strong>To mnie pan teraz pocieszył. Jestem w tym miejscu. Dlaczego tak się dzieje?</strong><br>\nNie wiem jak jest w pana przypadku, ale generalizując: w tym wieku praca nie jest już dla ludzi tak ekscytująca jak wtedy gdy zaczynali swoje kariery. Pojawiają się dzieci, radości ale i problemy z tym związane, oraz nie ukrywajmy - niemałe koszty. Dociera do nas, mówię tak, bo jestem na dość podobnym etapie, że jeszcze trochę ten mozół potrwa, zanim będziemy mogli odpocząć. No i ryzyko różnego rodzaju niestabilności światowych ciągle nas dotyczy. Gdy jest się młodym, mniej się myśli o tym co będzie za dwadzieścia lat na świecie. Gdy ma się lat osiemdziesiąt kilka to już też nie jest coś, co spędza ci sen z powiek.</p>\n</div>\n                    <div>\n            <blockquote>\n                    <p>\"Mieszkaniowe mieć czy być. Dobrostan Polaków na styku finansów i sposobów zamieszkiwania” - raport Otodom</p>\n                <p>62% badanych zdecydowanie nie chce brać kredytu hipotecznego\n70% kredytobiorców z perspektywy czasu ocenia tę decyzję jako słuszną \n</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n                    <div><p><strong>No dobrze, ale co z tą własnością mieszkania? Kredytem?</strong><br>\nTo też jest wynik, który potwierdza się w innych krajach. Własność sprzyja większemu zadowoleniu z życia. W mieszkaniu które jest twoje możesz zmienić co chcesz, możesz zerwać parkiet, albo zamalować go na zielono, poprzesuwać ściany jeśli tylko konstrukcja i twój budżet na to pozwalają. Poza tym mieszkanie rozumiane jako dom, twoje miejsce to ciągle coś, co lubimy definiować jako coś stałego, pewnego. Własność tę pewność wzmacnia.</p>\n<p><strong>I nawet generacja Z, która jeździ na pożyczanych na minuty rowerach czy hulajnogach, dużo podróżuje i ciągle zmienia kierunki swojej kariery tak uważa?</strong><br>\nLubię patrzeć na różne generacje nie jak na grupy społeczne, ale jak na etapy w życiu ludzi. Ktoś, kto dziś zalicza się do tej rzekomo wielbiącej swobodę i niezależność generacji Z za chwile wejdzie na rynek pracy, wejdzie w relację, pojawi się dziecko. I nasze badanie dokładnie to pokazuje, że właśnie wtedy skłonność do wzięcia kredytu i kupienia czegoś swojego rośnie. To jest wręcz tąpnięcie - wtedy nagle ci miłujący niezależność ludzie są w stanie bardzo dużo poświęcić, by osiąść na swoim.</p>\n<p><strong>I wszystkie te historie z kredytami frankowymi, z covidem i ratami zwykłych, złotówkowych kredytów, z niedostępnością kredytów dzisiaj nie przetrzepały nam głów, nie dały do myślenia?</strong></p>\n<p>Dały, jak najbardziej. To nasze badanie też to pokazuje. Gdy pytamy czy chciałbyś wziąć kredyt, to ponad pięćdziesiąt procent badanych odpowiada „zdecydowanie nie”, a tylko piętnaście procent rozważa taki scenariusz. Tych piętnaście procent jest też najmniej zadowolona z życia. Ludzie boją się tych różnych szoków, jakie na ścieżce spłacania kredytu ich czekają. Ja wziąłem kredyt i mogę powiedzieć, że ta decyzja zmieniła moje życie.</p>\n\n</div>\n                    <div>\n            <blockquote>\n                    <p>\"Mieszkaniowe mieć czy być.

W objęcia kredytu pcha ich wszystkich tylko ekonomiczna kalkulacja? Że lepiej spłacać po kawałku swoje niż płacić komuś za wynajem?</strong><br>\nTo ciągle bardzo silna motywacja, ma charakter wyraźnie negatywny. Ale są te inne. Na przykład to, że posiadanie mieszkania ma charakter statusowy. Posiadacze są uważani za bardziej poważnych i dorosłych niż wynajmujący.</p>\n<p><strong>Ale banki już przestały nas karmić reklamami, w których przebrany za przedszkolankę Szymon Majewski wręczał swoim przedszkolakom umowy kredytowe i one stawały się nagle w magiczny sposób w końcu dorosłymi ludźmi.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Ale kiedy widział pan ostatnio jakąś reklamę kredytu hipotecznego? Dostępność tych kredytów spadła, tu nie ma czego reklamować. Stąd te programy zero czy dwa procent. Żeby jakoś to udrożnić.</p>\n<p><strong>No dobrze. Z tego waszego badania wiem, że aby w kontekście mieszkaniowym moje zadowolenie z życia było największe powinienem mieć ponad sześćdziesiąt sześć lat i właśnie spłacić swój wieloletni kredyt hipoteczny. Ale z naszej rozmowy wiem, że tak to nie działa, że to nie jest ta prosta reguła, że jeśli A to B. Ewidentnie widać jednak w tym badaniu, że osoby starsze, seniorzy, są najbardziej zadowolone ze swojego miejsca zamieszkania. Czego możemy się od nich nauczyć, jakie postawy podglądać by samemu zadbać o swoje zadowolenie?</strong></p>\n<p>Po pierwsze relacje: osoby starsze, żyjąc w jednym miejscu długo mają tam już wydeptane swoje ścieżki - swój sklep i panią Krysię, która im schowa lepiej wypieczony bochenek, swoją aptekę, lekarza, ławeczkę w parku. To buduje poczucie szczęścia - życzliwi ludzie wokół. Po drugie to adaptacja - seniorzy są bardziej skłonni dostosować swoje życie, do warunków w jakich się znaleźli, jakoś się w tych warunkach ułożyć, umościć. Po trzecie aspiracje, a właściwie ich brak - oni już nie muszą się z nikim porównywać, nie patrzą co mają inni, jak mieszkają, czym jeżdżą. To jest w ogóle lekcja, która płynie z naszego badania. Gdy pytamy ludzi o to czy są zadowoleni ze stanu swojego posiadania to ten poziom zadowolenia zawsze jest wyższy od tego, który wynika z pytania czy są zadowoleni z tego co mają w porównaniu z innymi. NIe lubimy czuć się gorsi. Ale osoby starsze są na to nieco bardziej uodpornione. Wydaje się, że to zdrowa postawa - nie porównywać się z innymi, tylko budować własną satysfakcję w oparciu o samodzielnie definiowane parametry. Niezależnie czy dotyczy to twoich warunków mieszkaniowych, wakacji czy czegokolwiek innego.</p>\n</div>\n                    <div>\n            <blockquote>\n                    <p>\"Mieszkaniowe mieć czy być.

I jakbym miał obstawiać przed badaniem, to bym powiedział, że pewnie sześćdziesiąt procent osób by się z tym zgodziło. A nam wyszło tam raptem piętnaście procent. I teraz się zastanawiam, czy ci nasi badani są tacy refleksyjni czy oni po prostu przegapili to pytanie. Ale trzymam się tej pierwszej myśli. To by znaczyło, że te badania o szczęściu dotykają czegoś ważnego i niezwiązanego z pieniądzem. Nawet jeśli prowadzi je ekonomista.</p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n                    <div>\n                <figure>\n    <img title=\"10.03.23_0530\" data-caption=\"Piotr Michoń - ekonomista, który w swoich pracach łączy ekonomię z psychologią, socjologią, historią czy filozofią.

Jak to&nbsp;się stało, że&nbsp;podjęliście się tych działań?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Filip Kijowski</b>: Jeśli chodzi o&nbsp;mnie, wróciłem do&nbsp;Polski w&nbsp;2019 roku, po&nbsp;mieszkaniu przez&nbsp;12 lat za&nbsp;granicą, głównie w&nbsp;Londynie i&nbsp;przez&nbsp;chwilę w&nbsp;Bangkoku. Po&nbsp;przyjeździe do&nbsp;Polski nie&nbsp;miałem pojęcia, gdzie i&nbsp;jak odnaleźć jakąś formę wspólnoty czy&nbsp;miejsca, w&nbsp;których&nbsp;mógłbym czuć się komfortowo. Polskę pamiętałem z&nbsp;okresu nastoletniego, i&nbsp;choć miałem świadomość, że&nbsp;sytuacja była wtedy zupełnie inna, tamte wspomnienia trochę rzutowały na&nbsp;moją ocenę sytuacji. Wpadłem wtedy na&nbsp;pomysł, żeby&nbsp;zapytać się innych osób, jak się czują i&nbsp;zorganizowałem projekt – być może trochę naiwny – o&nbsp;nazwie <i>Tęczowe pocztówki</i>. Przez&nbsp;osiem miesięcy zapraszałem osoby napotkanie na&nbsp;ulicy w&nbsp;Warszawie, Lublinie i&nbsp;Wrocławiu do&nbsp;napisania pocztówki zadedykowanej Andrzejowi Dudzie. To&nbsp;było tuż po&nbsp;tym, gdy&nbsp;powiedział, że&nbsp;osoby LGBTQ+ są&nbsp;ideologią. Tych pocztówek powstało około 1500. Sporo osób pisało w&nbsp;nich o&nbsp;braku przestrzeni, w&nbsp;której&nbsp;mogłyby spotykać się na&nbsp;co&nbsp;dzień. W&nbsp;kontekście kultury LGBTQ+ mamy sporo klubów, barów, odbywają się festiwale, ale&nbsp;brakowało mi&nbsp;stałego miejsca poświęconego osobom queerowym i&nbsp;współtworzonego przez&nbsp;osoby queerowe bez&nbsp;jakiegoś sformalizowanego zarządu. W&nbsp;tych pocztówkach pojawiło się też kilkukrotnie słowo „azyl”.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To&nbsp;był moment, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;postanowiłeś zorganizować bibliotekę?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>FK:</b> Wtedy jeszcze nie&nbsp;wiedziałem, co&nbsp;się ze&nbsp;mną stanie. Myślałem o&nbsp;tym, żeby&nbsp;zrobić ten projekt i&nbsp;wrócić do&nbsp;Londynu, ale&nbsp;na&nbsp;zaproszenie Waldemara Tatarczuka dostałem propozycję odbycia rocznej, płatnej rezydencji w&nbsp;galerii Labirynt. Było to&nbsp;podczas pandemii, kiedy wiele osób straciło możliwość pracy, szczególnie z&nbsp;ludźmi i&nbsp;grupami społecznymi. Ta&nbsp;propozycja dała mi&nbsp;możliwość skupienia się nad&nbsp;wizją tworzenia biblioteki queerowej, ze&nbsp;strukturą uczestnictwa w&nbsp;zgodzie z&nbsp;lokalną społecznością. Już wtedy zastanawiałem się, czy&nbsp;data zakończenia rezydencji oznacza zakończenie projektu. Z&nbsp;galerią staraliśmy się stworzyć strukturę, dzięki której&nbsp;projekt będzie mógł dalej żyć i&nbsp;rosnąć. Mam wrażenie, że&nbsp;dopiero teraz, po&nbsp;czterech latach, poznajemy potencjał tego projektu – widać, czym mógłby on&nbsp;być, jeśli kontynuowalibyśmy pracę w&nbsp;strukturze, w&nbsp;której&nbsp;młode osoby z&nbsp;lokalnej społeczności mogą proponować swoje działania, a&nbsp;galeria zapewnia roczne kursy. A&nbsp;dlaczego podjąłem się tego działania? Dla mnie jest ważne, żeby&nbsp;móc działać kolektywnie w&nbsp;kierunku większego bezpieczeństwa i&nbsp;inkluzywności. Ciekawi mnie, jak doświadczenie z&nbsp;tych warsztatów można kontynuować w&nbsp;indywidualnych praktykach, ale&nbsp;i&nbsp;na&nbsp;co&nbsp;dzień.</p>\n<h6><span>Zatrudniając lub typując do&nbsp;pracy osobę z&nbsp;danej grupy, trzeba pamiętać, że&nbsp;nosi ona w&nbsp;sobie ogrom nasion, rozsiewających się dookoła.

I&nbsp;to&nbsp;właśnie nad&nbsp;tą&nbsp;siecią trzeba pracować.</span></h6>\n<p><b>Taras Gembik:</b> Zanim opowiem o&nbsp;tym, co&nbsp;aktualnie robię, chciałbym cofnąć się o&nbsp;jakieś siedem lat. W&nbsp;2017 roku, mając 22 lata, przyjechałem do&nbsp;Warszawy z&nbsp;Lublina. Dla mnie był to&nbsp;moment poszukiwania własnej tożsamości, a&nbsp;Warszawa była zupełnie innym miastem niż teraz. Mam tu&nbsp;na&nbsp;myśli także instytucje kultury i&nbsp;ofertę dla osób z&nbsp;doświadczeniem migranckim i&nbsp;uchodźctwa, osób w&nbsp;drodze. Szukałem miejsc, które mogłyby towarzyszyć mi&nbsp;w&nbsp;tym okresie i&nbsp;pomóc budować tożsamość młodego chłopaka po&nbsp;latach większego kryzysu, także bezdomności. Jednak jako osoba z&nbsp;Ukrainy mogłem się wówczas odbić jedynie o&nbsp;Ukraiński Dom, który&nbsp;tworzył określony wizerunek Ukraińca. Dla mnie była to&nbsp;za&nbsp;ciasna forma, nie&nbsp;chciałem definiować się według tych ram, tylko&nbsp;wejść w&nbsp;polskie społeczeństwo. Zależało mi&nbsp;na&nbsp;odnalezieniu własnej wspólnoty. Szukałem więc&nbsp;innych miejsc, i&nbsp;ich nie&nbsp;znalazłem. Jestem jednak osobą bardzo wierzącą w&nbsp;swoje umiejętności, nie&nbsp;zawsze podparte uprawnieniami typu zakończenie studiów, więc&nbsp;któregoś dnia po&nbsp;prostu napisałem na&nbsp;Instagramie do&nbsp;Muzeum Sztuki Nowoczesnej i&nbsp;zaproponowałem im, żebyśmy zrobili coś wspólnie dla społeczności ukraińskiej. Wtedy na&nbsp;terenie Polski oficjalnie było jej prawie milion. To&nbsp;zaskoczyło, muzeum zaprosiło mnie na&nbsp;rozmowę i&nbsp;zaproponowało udział w&nbsp;festiwalu Warszawa w&nbsp;Budowie. Była to&nbsp;edycja poświęcona sąsiedztwu i&nbsp;zdaje się pierwsza inicjatywa w&nbsp;wystawiennictwie, która&nbsp;zwracała uwagę na&nbsp;osoby z&nbsp;Ukrainy. Tak&nbsp;się zaczęła moja współpraca z&nbsp;MSN-em – współpracowałem z&nbsp;muzeum jako edukator, poznałem pracującą już tam Marię Beburię i&nbsp;razem organizowaliśmy małe wydarzenia, jak oprowadzania w&nbsp;języku ukraińskim. Te&nbsp;działania ewoluowały do&nbsp;powstania Blyzkist, później Antykryzysowego Klubu, następnie Słonecznika, a&nbsp;ja&nbsp;zacząłem działać także w&nbsp;innych instytucjach kultury.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Wasze działania koncentrują się na&nbsp;współpracy ze&nbsp;społecznościami, budowaniu wspólnoty. To&nbsp;trochę coś innego niż zwyczajowa działalność instytucji, koncentrująca się wokół wystaw i&nbsp;wydarzeń towarzyszących. Jak wygląda praca ze&nbsp;społecznością, jak się taki proces inicjuje?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG</b>: Zatrudniając lub typując do&nbsp;pracy osobę z&nbsp;danej grupy, trzeba pamiętać, że&nbsp;nosi ona w&nbsp;sobie ogrom nasion, rozsiewających się dookoła. Człowiek nie&nbsp;jest zamkniętym organizmem, tylko&nbsp;zakorzenionym w&nbsp;sieci kontaktów. I&nbsp;to&nbsp;właśnie nad&nbsp;tą&nbsp;siecią trzeba pracować. Kolejny krok to&nbsp;współpraca z&nbsp;trzecim sektorem, NGO-sami, które mogłyby pośredniczyć między instytucją i&nbsp;grupami mniejszościowymi. Jest to&nbsp;niezbędne w&nbsp;sytuacji, w&nbsp;której&nbsp;instytucje kultury operują ograniczonymi zasobami ludzkimi.</p>\n\t\n\t\n<p><b>FK:</b> Praca w&nbsp;grupie to&nbsp;praktyka, której&nbsp;ciągle się uczę, teraz także w&nbsp;ramach studiów online w&nbsp;Londyńskiej Szkole Tańca Współczesnego, które skupiają się nad&nbsp;tym, jak zapraszać intersekcjonalne społeczności i&nbsp;grupy mniejszościowe do&nbsp;współtworzenia choreografii i&nbsp;warsztatów tanecznych. Kierunek studiów to&nbsp;<em>MA&nbsp;Dance: Participation, Communities, Activism</em>. W&nbsp;autorskiej praktyce <i>Becoming Allies</i>, którą współtworzę z&nbsp;grupami rodziców osób LGBTQ+ oraz&nbsp;innymi grupami społecznościowymi, w&nbsp;dużej mierze chodzi o&nbsp;przygotowanie ciała do&nbsp;gotowości „sojuszniczenia”. Ciekawi mnie, jak możemy trenować nasze instynkty – poprzez zabawy, ćwiczenia, dotyk, energię czy&nbsp;głębsze słuchanie – i&nbsp;w&nbsp;ten sposób przygotować ciało, umiejętności miękkie, kolektywne myślenie do&nbsp;działania. Jeśli zaś chodzi o&nbsp;Lublin, praca tam zaczęła się od&nbsp;zauważenia mapy powiązań – pomiędzy osobami na&nbsp;studiach, osobami uczącymi się w&nbsp;lokalnym plastyku, osobami już angażującymi się w&nbsp;zręby działań aktywistycznych. Poza Biblioteką Azyl w&nbsp;Lublinie od&nbsp;siedmiu lat działa Marsz Równości, jest też Piwnica Labiryntu, Przegięcie czy&nbsp;Festival Queerz Get Loud. Zaletą Azylu jest stałe miejsce, otwarte kilka dni w&nbsp;tygodniu, do&nbsp;którego&nbsp;można przyjść. Organizujemy w&nbsp;nim wydarzenia, w&nbsp;które można angażować się na&nbsp;różnych poziomach. Można być inicjatorem działania i&nbsp;zgłosić swój pomysł przez&nbsp;open calla, a&nbsp;zespół Biblioteki Azyl wspiera proces powstawania projektu. Taka strategia pomagała nam powiększyć zespół, ale&nbsp;także wymagała rezygnacji z&nbsp;ego w&nbsp;tym sensie, że&nbsp;program Biblioteki Azyl nie&nbsp;jest odzwierciedleniem zainteresowań wąskiej grupy organizatorów, na&nbsp;przykład moich, Waldka Tatarczuka, czy&nbsp;dwóch osób, które współtworzą kolektyw: Anastas Krusińskiej i&nbsp;Arieli Michalak. Zamiast tego energia kolektywu zasila rozwój pomysłów i&nbsp;osób korzystających z&nbsp;biblioteki. Dla przykładu odbywały się u&nbsp;nas regularne spotkania o&nbsp;bezpiecznej praktyce robienia tatuaży, były spotkania wokół Biblii queerowej czy&nbsp;tworzenia zinów. To&nbsp;nie&nbsp;są&nbsp;tematy zahaczające o&nbsp;moje&nbsp;osobiste praktyki artystyczne, ale&nbsp;dla mnie na&nbsp;tym polega sojusznictwo – że&nbsp;idziemy za&nbsp;kulisy i&nbsp;zza nich wspieramy osoby wchodzące w&nbsp;działanie i&nbsp;większą widoczność. Nie&nbsp;jest to&nbsp;praktyka, której&nbsp;można raz się nauczyć, bo&nbsp;każdy proces współtworzenia jest inny w&nbsp;zależności od&nbsp;kontekstu i&nbsp;uwarunkowań.</p>\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Taras, w&nbsp;ramach Klubu Antykryzysowego współpracujesz z&nbsp;osobami bezdomnymi, organizujesz dla nich oprowadzania i&nbsp;warsztaty w&nbsp;MSN-ie. Z&nbsp;mojego&nbsp;punktu widzenia to&nbsp;jakby zderzenie dwóch światów, prowokujące do&nbsp;pytania – co&nbsp;instytucje sztuki mogą zaoferować takiej grupie? Jaki ma&nbsp;być rezultat działania klubu?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG:</b> Może na&nbsp;początek zaznaczę, że&nbsp;myśląc o&nbsp;pracy w&nbsp;grupie warto odejść od&nbsp;kapitalistycznej logiki, w&nbsp;której&nbsp;proces musi doprowadzić do&nbsp;realizacji jakiegoś celu. Niewykluczone, że&nbsp;to, co&nbsp;robimy, jest już wystarczające dla naszej docelowej grupy osób, i&nbsp;samo ich spotkanie w&nbsp;instytucji jest celem. Na&nbsp;efekty tych spotkań trzeba często dłużej poczekać, o&nbsp;czym warto pamiętać w&nbsp;pracy z&nbsp;grupami wykluczonymi. Przykładem mogą być tutaj właśnie osoby w&nbsp;kryzysie bezdomności. Statystycznie jest ich na&nbsp;ulicach Warszawy coraz więcej, i&nbsp;ten proces nie&nbsp;ustanie ze&nbsp;względu na&nbsp;niewydolność państwa w&nbsp;kwestiach mieszkalnictwa. W&nbsp;tym kontekście lokalizacja Muzeum Sztuki Nowoczesnej jest znacząca. Lubię powtarzać, że&nbsp;to&nbsp;nie&nbsp;bezdomni będą gośćmi MSN-u, ale&nbsp;MSN jest gościem w&nbsp;ich dzielnicy. Niedaleko muzeum jest w&nbsp;końcu Patelnia, gdzie cztery razy w&nbsp;tygodniu osobom potrzebującym wydawane jest jedzenie. Te&nbsp;osoby później się rozchodzą, mogą pójść choćby do&nbsp;tego pięknego pałacu sztuki obok. W&nbsp;przypadku działań Klubu Antykryzysowego, który&nbsp;tworzę z&nbsp;Robertem Kwaśniewskim, Dorotą Szapowską i&nbsp;działem edukacji MSN-u, pierwszą sprawą jest zrozumienie, że&nbsp;nie&nbsp;jesteśmy fundacją. Nie&nbsp;oferujemy usług psychologicznych czy&nbsp;leków. Jako instytucja kultury oferujemy za&nbsp;to&nbsp;dostęp do&nbsp;ubikacji, możliwość skorzystania z&nbsp;ciepła w&nbsp;zimie lub klimatyzacji w&nbsp;lecie, a&nbsp;także dostęp do&nbsp;wody, ciepłej lub zimnej. Raz na&nbsp;tydzień w&nbsp;Klubie organizujemy obiad dla około dziesięciu osób uczestniczących w&nbsp;naszych spotkaniach. To&nbsp;jest etap pierwszy, dotyczący wymiaru humanitarnego. Jeśli zaś chodzi o&nbsp;ten artystyczny – sztuka ma&nbsp;niesamowitą właściwość przywracania osobom w&nbsp;kryzysie możliwość fantazji, krytycznego myślenia, zabrania głosu. Gdy&nbsp;spędzasz całe dnie na&nbsp;ulicy i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;rozmawiasz z&nbsp;nikim, widzisz w&nbsp;kolejkach po&nbsp;jedzenie cały czas tych samych ludzi, Klub może stać się miejscem, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;możesz odzyskać głos. Twoje&nbsp;zdanie jest słyszalne.</p>\n<p><b>FK</b>: To&nbsp;jest zmora wszelkich aplikacji grantowych, w&nbsp;których&nbsp;od&nbsp;razu trzeba wiedzieć, jaki będzie rezultat czy&nbsp;też końcowy produkt naszego działania. W&nbsp;Azylu jednak także staramy się odchodzić od&nbsp;takiego myślenia, raczej skupiając się na&nbsp;refleksji nad&nbsp;tym, jaki wpływ na&nbsp;otoczenie ma&nbsp;to, co&nbsp;robimy, i&nbsp;czy&nbsp;jest to&nbsp;naprawdę potrzebne. Zdaliśmy sobie przy okazji sprawę, że&nbsp;wpływu nie&nbsp;da się do&nbsp;końca wymierzyć. Niektóre rzeczy możemy zaobserwować podczas spotkania, ale&nbsp;wiele dzieje się poza. Na&nbsp;przykład od&nbsp;czasu, kiedy istnieje Biblioteka Azyl, w&nbsp;Lublinie powstało kilka innych kolektywów, które zaczęły niezależną pracę i&nbsp;organizują spotkania u&nbsp;siebie w&nbsp;domach. To&nbsp;jest wspaniałe, tym bardziej, że&nbsp;osoby, które przychodzą do&nbsp;nas, często wspominają, że&nbsp;ich głosy są&nbsp;w&nbsp;procesie edukacji czy&nbsp;szerzej rozumianej socjalizacji uciszane. Dla wielu osób queerowych praca z&nbsp;tematyką tożsamościową nigdy nie&nbsp;była realna, nie&nbsp;postrzegały jej jako praktycznej. Jednym z&nbsp;najskuteczniejszych działań Azylu są&nbsp;kręgi, które powstały przy współpracy z&nbsp;Anastas Krusińską, które prowadzimy kolektywnie w&nbsp;trzyosobowym zespole. Podczas nich praktykujemy publiczne mówienie, słuchanie i&nbsp;słyszenie innych perspektyw. W&nbsp;trakcie tych dwóch lat pracy widać, że&nbsp;ciała niektórych osób uczestniczących przeszły transformację. Na&nbsp;pierwszych spotkaniach były schowane w&nbsp;swojej klatce piersiowej, mówiły niewiele i&nbsp;krótkimi zdaniami. W&nbsp;tym roku zaś miały solowe wystawy, były odpowiedzialne za&nbsp;prowadzenie autorskich działań. Takie więc&nbsp;mogą być rezultaty pracy w&nbsp;Azylu. Fajnie jest mieć możliwość, by&nbsp;ich nie&nbsp;dookreślać, tylko&nbsp;dać im&nbsp;możliwość do&nbsp;pojawienia się i&nbsp;rozwinięcia. Ważna jest dla nas wiedza zawarta w&nbsp;książce <i>Emergent Strategy</i> adrienne maree brown. Przy okazji często zastanawiam się, czy&nbsp;instytucja kultury jest odpowiednim sojusznikiem do&nbsp;tego rodzaju zadań. Jak już powiedział Taras, instytucje kultury mają trochę innym profil niż instytucje opieki społecznej. Wiem jednak, że&nbsp;są&nbsp;osoby, które organizują swój kalendarz wokół tej&nbsp;jednej soboty, kiedy odbywa się krąg.</p>\n<h6><span>Jeśli instytucja, która&nbsp;nie&nbsp;ma&nbsp;doświadczenia w&nbsp;pracy z&nbsp;grupą mniejszościową, bierze feedback grupy jako atak czy&nbsp;skargę, to&nbsp;wtedy zaczynam mieć wątpliwości, czy&nbsp;faktycznie mamy tu&nbsp;do&nbsp;czynienia z&nbsp;praktyką empatii.</span></h6>\n<blockquote><p>Pomimo ograniczonych zasobów instytucje sztuki i&nbsp;kultury lubią definiować się jako sojusznicze wobec różnych grup społecznych. Wywieszają na&nbsp;drzwiach tęczowe flagi, zmieniają loga na&nbsp;tęczowe, organizują oprowadzania dla grup marginalizowanych lub mniejszościowych, i&nbsp;tak&nbsp;dalej. Zastanawiam się jednak, jak z&nbsp;waszej perspektywy powinno wyglądać praktykowanie empatii w&nbsp;instytucjach sztuki?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>FK:</b> Wydaje mi&nbsp;się, że&nbsp;o&nbsp;ile praktykowanie empatii w&nbsp;kontekście instytucji kultury jest niezwykle istotne, na&nbsp;początek warto jednak wspólnie zdefiniować, czym jest empatia. Dla mnie empatia nie&nbsp;zatrzymuje się na&nbsp;intencji zmiany, ale&nbsp;opiera się na&nbsp;działaniu. Empatia jest dla mnie czasownikiem. Ważna jest w&nbsp;niej umiejętność słuchania głosu lokalnej społeczności przed&nbsp;programowaniem jakiegoś działania, które wiąże się z&nbsp;ryzykiem tego, że&nbsp;otwarcie w&nbsp;budynku czy&nbsp;online mówimy o&nbsp;grupach z&nbsp;mniejszości. W&nbsp;instytucjach powinna być przestrzeń do&nbsp;głębokiego słuchania, zadawania pytań, ale&nbsp;także otwartość na&nbsp;feedback i&nbsp;krytykę. A&nbsp;jeśli taka się zdarzy, warto nie&nbsp;brać tego osobiście, bo&nbsp;w&nbsp;końcu chodzi o&nbsp;naukę. Jeśli instytucja, która&nbsp;nie&nbsp;ma&nbsp;doświadczenia w&nbsp;pracy z&nbsp;grupą mniejszościową, bierze feedback grupy jako atak czy&nbsp;skargę, to&nbsp;wtedy zaczynam mieć wątpliwości, czy&nbsp;faktycznie mamy tu&nbsp;do&nbsp;czynienia z&nbsp;praktyką empatii. Jest taka teoretyczka Barbara Joan Love, która&nbsp;w&nbsp;eseju <i>Developing a&nbsp;Liberatory Consciousness</i> zaproponowała cztery stopnie stawania się osobą sojuszniczą. Pierwszą z&nbsp;nich jest <i>awareness</i>, czyli wrażliwość i&nbsp;dostrzeganie, że&nbsp;coś jest nie&nbsp;tak. Czyli na&nbsp;przykład prowadzimy rozmowę na&nbsp;jakiś temat i&nbsp;zauważamy, że&nbsp;brakuje określonego głosu. Albo&nbsp;brakuje reprezentacji pewnej społeczności podczas podejmowania decyzji dotyczącej większego grona osób. W&nbsp;tej&nbsp;wrażliwości ważne jest także zrozumienie własnych stereotypów. Czyli zrozumienia, skąd wynika nasza opinia i&nbsp;czym jest powodowana wiedza na&nbsp;temat tej&nbsp;grupy. Drugi etap to&nbsp;analiza, czyli refleksja o&nbsp;tym, co&nbsp;o&nbsp;danej grupie społecznej faktycznie wiem. Czyli jeśli np.&nbsp;chcemy współpracować z&nbsp;młodymi osobami transpłciowymi, warto zdobyć wiedzę na&nbsp;temat codzienności tych osób, funkcjonowania w&nbsp;szkole, rodzinie i&nbsp;innych kontekstach prawa czy&nbsp;polityki. Ta&nbsp;wiedza jest dostępna, są&nbsp;raporty, artykuły, podcasty i&nbsp;konta internetowe, często prowadzone przez&nbsp;samych zainteresowanych, który&nbsp;opowiadają o&nbsp;realiach życia danej grupy w&nbsp;Polsce. Kolejnym krokiem jest robienie, „sojuszniczenie”, czyli działanie, a&nbsp;nie&nbsp;tylko&nbsp;myślenie o&nbsp;sobie jako osobie czy&nbsp;instytucji sojuszniczej. Tutaj ważna jest kwestia samoidentyfikacji – czy&nbsp;my&nbsp;sami nazywamy się sojusznikami, czy&nbsp;też raczej czekamy aż&nbsp;grupa osób, z&nbsp;którymi współpracujemy, sama nada nam ten tytuł. Ostatnim punktem jest <i>accountability </i>– weryfikacja działań razem z&nbsp;grupą, z&nbsp;którą coś robiliśmy. Słuchanie ich, zadawanie pytań, zbieranie feedbacku. Wydaje mi&nbsp;się, że&nbsp;przy każdym wydarzeniu czy&nbsp;inicjatywie ten proces można powtarzać. Ja&nbsp;czasami patrzę na&nbsp;empatię jako mięsień, z&nbsp;którym&nbsp;można pracować jak na&nbsp;siłowni.</p>\n\t\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Taras, czym jest według ciebie sojusznictwo? Jaka powinna być instytucja sojusznicza?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG:</b> Instytucja sojusznicza to&nbsp;przede wszystkim taka, która&nbsp;zatrudnia, płaci i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;wykorzystuje. Niestety, instytucje kultury mają bardzo małe zasoby wiedzy na&nbsp;temat społeczności wokół nich. Po&nbsp;prostu nie&nbsp;są&nbsp;tak&nbsp;sprofilowane i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;mają na&nbsp;to&nbsp;czasu. Tymczasem polskie społeczeństwo nie&nbsp;jest już homogeniczne, cały czas się zmienia, zmienia się więc&nbsp;tkanka miejska i&nbsp;odbiorcy tych instytucji. Ten proces już się nie&nbsp;zatrzyma. Czym prędzej to&nbsp;zrozumiemy, także na&nbsp;poziomie praktyk zarządzania instytucją, tym lepiej. Na&nbsp;razie mam wrażenie, że&nbsp;tkwimy w&nbsp;starym modelu rozumienia instytucji, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;instytucje kultury, które zatrudniają osoby wyłącznie z&nbsp;tej&nbsp;samej społeczności, mogą opierać się na&nbsp;tak&nbsp;zwanym wiązanym kapitale społecznym (<i>bonding social capital</i>), który&nbsp;wzmacnia więzi wewnętrzne, ale&nbsp;jednocześnie ogranicza otwartość na&nbsp;osoby spoza grupy. Taki model może prowadzić do&nbsp;homogeniczności w&nbsp;myśleniu, ograniczonej innowacyjności i&nbsp;braku perspektyw różnorodnych środowisk. Moje&nbsp;działania polegają na&nbsp;rozszczelnieniu instytucji i&nbsp;próbach zmieniania podejścia do&nbsp;grup mniejszościowych i&nbsp;marginalizowanych – chciałbym, żeby&nbsp;uwzględniano je&nbsp;już na&nbsp;poziomie budowania całościowej strategii instytucji. I&nbsp;to&nbsp;nie&nbsp;tylko&nbsp;jako odbiorców tych działań, ale&nbsp;także (współ)pracowników. Marzy mi&nbsp;się, by&nbsp;w&nbsp;muzeach powstawały – na&nbsp;wzór działów dostępności dla osób z&nbsp;niepełnosprawnościami – działy dostępności dla grup mniejszościowych. Dla mnie instytucja sojusznicza to&nbsp;instytucja odpowiedzialna, która&nbsp;nie&nbsp;tylko&nbsp;organizuje oprowadzania w&nbsp;języku ukraińskim, ale&nbsp;otwiera swoją strukturę dla osób z&nbsp;tych grup. Tymczasem, jeśli prześledzić statystyki (czym chcę się teraz zajmować na&nbsp;studiach), wychodzi, że&nbsp;procent osób z&nbsp;mniejszości zatrudnionych w&nbsp;instytucjach kultury to&nbsp;jest nie&nbsp;więcej niż jeden.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Na&nbsp;jakich warunkach współpracowaliście z&nbsp;waszymi partnerskimi instytucjami? Czy&nbsp;to&nbsp;była praca płatna, czy&nbsp;<i>pro bono</i>?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG: </b>Ja&nbsp;za&nbsp;swoją pracę w&nbsp;Muzeum Sztuki Nowoczesnej zawsze dostawałem wynagrodzenie. To, jakie to&nbsp;było wynagrodzenie, to&nbsp;jest inna sprawa, która&nbsp;dotyczy też szerszego kontekstu pracy i&nbsp;płac w&nbsp;instytucjach kultury, form zatrudnienia i&nbsp;współpracy między innymi z&nbsp;osobami migranckimi. Niestety wydaje mi&nbsp;się, że&nbsp;jesteśmy bardzo daleko od&nbsp;zrozumienia, że&nbsp;ta&nbsp;współpraca nie&nbsp;powinna polegać na&nbsp;zasadzie jednorazowego zasysania zasobów w&nbsp;celu uzyskania czasowego statusu instytucji postempatycznej. I&nbsp;nie&nbsp;chodzi tylko&nbsp;o&nbsp;to, żeby&nbsp;jakoś opłacać pracę osób współpracujących z&nbsp;instytucjami, ale&nbsp;dać im&nbsp;poczucie podstawowego zabezpieczenia ekonomicznego i&nbsp;socjalnego. Takiego poczucia na&nbsp;pewno nie&nbsp;da praca na&nbsp;śmieciówce.</p>\n<p><b>FK:</b> Odwołam się jeszcze do&nbsp;procesu zakreślonego przez&nbsp;Love, bo&nbsp;Bibliotece Azyl trochę go&nbsp;brakowało. Warunki zatrudnienia osób działających w&nbsp;Azylu nie&nbsp;zawsze były wygodne. Jak wspomniałem, ja&nbsp;najpierw działałem w&nbsp;ramach płatnej rezydencji. Drugi rok pracowałem bez&nbsp;żadnej umowy, i&nbsp;to&nbsp;był też moment, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;Waldemar Tatarczuk był zwolniony ze&nbsp;swojej pozycji dyrektora i&nbsp;inna osoba pełniła jego obowiązki. Los Biblioteki Azyl był wtedy bardzo niepewny, nie&nbsp;wiadomo było, czy&nbsp;po&nbsp;mojej&nbsp;rezydencji będzie mogła dalej funkcjonować. Tym, co&nbsp;nas uratowało, to&nbsp;fakt, że&nbsp;zakończeniem rezydencji miała być wystawa. Zaproponowaliśmy wtedy razem z&nbsp;Waldemarem, żeby&nbsp;wystawą była biblioteka. Dzięki temu udało się otworzyć miejsce, które funkcjonuje już trzeci rok. Jeśli zaś chodzi o&nbsp;warunki pracy, przez&nbsp;ostatnie dwa lata pracowałem na&nbsp;umowach-zlecenie, często za&nbsp;wynagrodzenie na&nbsp;poziomie najniższej krajowej. Dodatkowe osoby zaangażowane do&nbsp;pracy przy projekcie zatrudniliśmy z&nbsp;grantów. Wszystkie nasze działania w&nbsp;Azylu – wystawy z&nbsp;lokalnymi społecznościami, dziesięć rezydencji dla artystów i&nbsp;artystek queerowych z&nbsp;Ukrainy, w&nbsp;ramach których&nbsp;trzeba było opłacić mieszkanie, honoraria, przejazdy i&nbsp;warsztaty – finansowaliśmy z&nbsp;grantów, zdobywanych i&nbsp;pisanych przeze mnie czy&nbsp;trzyosobowy kolektyw osób działających w&nbsp;Azylu.</p>\n<h6><span>Chciałbym, aby instytucje przestały traktować osoby z&nbsp;mniejszości lub grup wykluczonych jako obiekty do&nbsp;budowania własnego kapitału. Jednak bez&nbsp;walki o&nbsp;zmianę to&nbsp;się raczej nie&nbsp;uda.</span></h6>\n<blockquote><p>Działalność takich inicjatyw jak wasze mają niemałe znaczenie dla kreowania wizerunku instytucji, jednak po&nbsp;tym, co&nbsp;powiedzieliście, zastanawiam się, na&nbsp;ile one są&nbsp;faktycznie zaangażowane tego typu projekty. Czy&nbsp;nie&nbsp;funkcjonujecie trochę na&nbsp;doklejkę?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG</b>: To&nbsp;niestety jest częste uczcie podczas współpracy z&nbsp;instytucją kultury. Według mnie inicjatywy takie jak Azyl, Słonecznik czy&nbsp;Klub Antykryzysowy są&nbsp;fenomenalne. Ale&nbsp;zanim sam sobie tego nie&nbsp;powiesz, nikt tego inny nie&nbsp;zrobi. Trzeba nauczyć się sobie z&nbsp;tym radzić. <a href=\"https://magazynrtv.com/wydanie-18/krytyka/nic-o-nas-bez-nas-o-sytuacji-osob-migranckich-pracujacych-w-kulturze-w-polsce/\">Ostatnio Maria Beburia na&nbsp;łamach magazynu „RTV</a>” pisała o&nbsp;tym, żeby&nbsp;instytucje przestały traktować osoby z&nbsp;mniejszości lub grup wykluczonych jako obiekty do&nbsp;budowania własnego kapitału. Chciałbym, żeby&nbsp;instytucje wzięły to&nbsp;sobie do&nbsp;serca. Jednak bez&nbsp;walki o&nbsp;zmianę to&nbsp;się raczej nie&nbsp;uda. Ale&nbsp;ja&nbsp;jestem bardzo cierpliwy, mam dużo zasobów, żeby&nbsp;czekać, i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;odpuszczę. Będę tam tak&nbsp;długo, dopóki mnie nie&nbsp;wyrzucą. Takie trwanie wymaga oczywiście umiejętności budowania własnej polityki wobec wizji osób pracujących w&nbsp;instytucji – tego, czego one oczekują i&nbsp;co&nbsp;chcą robić. Można powiedzieć, że&nbsp;to&nbsp;jest gra, której&nbsp;wynikiem jest na&nbsp;przykład dostęp do&nbsp;ciepłej wody.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Filip, jak to&nbsp;wygląda z&nbsp;perspektywy Lublina? Ostatnio przy okazji Performance Platform Lublin doszło do&nbsp;konfliktu na&nbsp;linii organizatorzy-część osób uczestniczących, dosyć zastanawiającego w&nbsp;kontekście kilkuletniej działalności Biblioteki Azyl.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>FK:</b> W&nbsp;Lublinie sytuacja jest o&nbsp;tyle ciekawa, że&nbsp;Labirynt jest instytucją podlegającą pod&nbsp;miasto. Ratusz jest zarządzany konserwatywnie i&nbsp;totalnie nie&nbsp;jest zainteresowany naszymi praktykami i&nbsp;nigdy bezpośrednio nie&nbsp;wspierał nas finansowo w&nbsp;kontekście programowych. Natomiast zawsze otrzymywaliśmy wsparcie z&nbsp;budżetu Galerii Labirynt, jeśli chodzi o&nbsp;pokrycie kosztów przestrzeni czy&nbsp;innych podstaw. Było jednak kilka momentów, gdy&nbsp;to, co&nbsp;robimy, było miastu bardzo na&nbsp;korzyść, na&nbsp;przykład podczas walki o&nbsp;tytuł Europejskiej Stolicy Kultury. Dostawaliśmy wtedy komunikaty z&nbsp;prośbami o&nbsp;statystyki działań dla osób LGBTQ+, bo&nbsp;oni chcieliby się pochwalić tymi danymi w&nbsp;swojej aplikacji. Ten rodzaj tokenizacji nie&nbsp;jest dla mnie zaskakujący, to&nbsp;raczej standardowa sytuacja – gdy&nbsp;potrzebujemy wsparcia, jesteśmy ignorowani, a&nbsp;gdy&nbsp;ktoś potrzebuje wpisać jakieś osiągnięcia do&nbsp;aplikacji, jesteśmy uwzględnieni. Wspominam o&nbsp;tym, bo&nbsp;mam nadzieję, że&nbsp;w&nbsp;przyszłości miasto bedzie miało bardziej skuteczne formy sojuszu z&nbsp;wszystkimi inicjatywami oddolnymi, z&nbsp;którymi współpracuje. Dla mnie praktyka bycia w&nbsp;instytucji jest nawigacją pomiędzy oporem i&nbsp;troską. Potrzebna jest asertywność i&nbsp;cierpliwość.</p>\n\t\n\t\n<blockquote><p>Opór z&nbsp;jakiej strony? Twojej, instytucji?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>FK:</b> Instytucji, miasta – ale&nbsp;także mój, w&nbsp;tym sensie, że&nbsp;nie&nbsp;odpuszczam. To, co&nbsp;jest również znaczące, to&nbsp;fakt, że&nbsp;galeria Labirynt i&nbsp;Biblioteka Azyl, będąc jedną instytucją, mają w&nbsp;zasadzie różną publiczność. Mieliśmy wystawy w&nbsp;Azylu, na&nbsp;które przychodziło po&nbsp;160 osób. To&nbsp;jest dla mnie znak, że&nbsp;robimy coś, co&nbsp;jest dla tej&nbsp;społeczności potrzebne i&nbsp;ważne. Wydaje mi&nbsp;się, że&nbsp;nawet dzięki naszym praktykom moglibyśmy uczyć inne instytucje, co&nbsp;mogłyby robić, by&nbsp;poszerzyć swoją widownię. Także widownię ogólną, nie&nbsp;tylko&nbsp;skoncentrowaną wokół konkretnej społeczności.</p>\n<blockquote><p>W&nbsp;kontekście afery na&nbsp;Performance Platform Lublin zastanawiałam się, jak powinna postąpić instytucja, gdy&nbsp;przydarzy się jej fakap, jest jakaś trudna sytuacja, raniąca osoby bądź społeczność i&nbsp;trzeba na&nbsp;nią zareagować.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>FK: </b>Jeśli instytucja deklaruje się jako sojusznicza, a&nbsp;zdarzy się jej błąd, musi wykonać pracę i&nbsp;risercz, który&nbsp;pozwoli jej na&nbsp;autorefleksję, a&nbsp;nawet samokrytykę. Myślę, że&nbsp;taka autorefleksja jest bardzo ważna, szczególnie w&nbsp;świecie współczesnych mediów, w&nbsp;których&nbsp;informacja rozprzestrzenia się błyskawicznie i&nbsp;na&nbsp;jej podstawie, bez&nbsp;znajomości dokładnego kontekstu, łatwo jest budować opinię. Warto więc&nbsp;słuchać głosów osób poszkodowanych, zadbać o&nbsp;nich potrzeby i&nbsp;się do&nbsp;nich bezpośrednio odnieść.</p>\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n<p><b>TG:</b> Myślę, że&nbsp;tworzenie bezpiecznej przestrzeni dla grup wykluczonych czy&nbsp;mniejszościowych jest bardzo ważne, szczególnie w&nbsp;instytucjach kultury, gdzie istnieje ryzyko gettoizacji tych grup. Dajmy na&nbsp;to: oprowadzania w&nbsp;różnych językach. Dla instytucji ich organizacja jest łatwa, a&nbsp;dla grupy kusząca. Uczestnictwo w&nbsp;takim oprowadzaniu jednak nie&nbsp;sprawia, że&nbsp;ta&nbsp;grupa wychodzi poza swoją bańkę.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nie&nbsp;integruje się?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG:</b> Dokładnie. To&nbsp;jest sytuacja zamknięta, w&nbsp;której&nbsp;możesz operować jednym kodem językowym. Nie&nbsp;prowadzi ona do&nbsp;poznania, oswajania innych dźwięków czy&nbsp;słów, tylko&nbsp;jest sposobem na&nbsp;odhaczenie jakiegoś zadania. Tymczasem wprowadzanie prawdziwej zmiany, gdzie osoby z&nbsp;różnych grup społecznych zbliżają się do&nbsp;siebie i&nbsp;zawiązują się pomiędzy nimi przyjaźnie, nie&nbsp;jest szybkie i&nbsp;wymaga bardziej złożonych działań.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Czyli jeśli nie&nbsp;oprowadzania w&nbsp;różnych językach, to&nbsp;co?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG:</b> Choćby oprowadzań w&nbsp;języku mieszanym. Marcin Matuszewski w&nbsp;Muzeum Narodowym robi cykl <i>Po&nbsp;prostu: oprowadzania w&nbsp;prostym języku polskim</i>, dedykowany osobom oswajającym się z&nbsp;tym językiem. Takich prostych narzędzi integracji jest wiele, wypracowanych przez&nbsp;różne miejsca. Świetne rzeczy robi Museo Reina Sofia, tamtejszy dział edukacji jest wspaniałym przykładem, jak można włączać grupy uchodźcze, migranckie i&nbsp;tak&nbsp;dalej, które w&nbsp;wyobrażeniu państwa są&nbsp;grupami przestępczymi. W&nbsp;madryckim muzeum udaje się włączyć te&nbsp;osoby nie&nbsp;tylko&nbsp;jako słuchaczy, ale&nbsp;i&nbsp;aktywnych działaczy, którzy&nbsp;angażują swoją społeczność.</p>\n\t\n\t\n<p><b>FK:</b> Też chciałbym, żebyśmy podążali w&nbsp;kierunku dalszej integracji. Ona nie&nbsp;jest łatwa, bo&nbsp;czasem osoby uczestniczące w&nbsp;naszych wydarzeniach, które są&nbsp;w&nbsp;jakimś trudnym momencie, nie&nbsp;mają w&nbsp;sobie przestrzeni na&nbsp;integrację np.&nbsp;z&nbsp;osobami niequeerowymi. W&nbsp;Azylu już samo spotkanie osób queerowych o&nbsp;bardzo różnych tożsamościach jest sporą integracją. Mnie samego interesuje jednak także praca w&nbsp;strukturach i&nbsp;miejscach, w&nbsp;których&nbsp;queerowe historie i&nbsp;teorie można przedstawiać w&nbsp;większych, międzykulturowych i&nbsp;pokoleniowych społecznościach. Na&nbsp;przykład wartościowe wydaje mi&nbsp;się opowiadanie osobom starszym o&nbsp;queerowości. Dobrze jest to&nbsp;robić w&nbsp;przystępny i&nbsp;prosty sposób – po&nbsp;to, żeby&nbsp;ich nie&nbsp;wykluczać i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;osądzać, że&nbsp;czegoś nie&nbsp;wiedzą. Chodzi o&nbsp;to, żeby&nbsp;nie&nbsp;pracować w&nbsp;sposób przymuszający, ale&nbsp;zapraszający do&nbsp;poznawania wiedzy. Skoro już padło hasło getto, choć może wolę określenie wyspy, to&nbsp;uważam, że&nbsp;warto tworzyć pomiędzy nimi pomosty. Trzeba jednak uszanować to, że&nbsp;niektóre społeczności nie&nbsp;zawsze są&nbsp;na&nbsp;nie&nbsp;gotowe i&nbsp;zastanowić się, jakie praktyki pomogą wypracować tę&nbsp;gotowość. Kiedyś w&nbsp;Azylu mieliśmy fotograficzną wystawę Sylwestra Iżowskiego <i>Psy też ludzie</i>. Składała się z&nbsp;siedmiu portretów mężczyzn mieszkających w&nbsp;Polsce i&nbsp;należących do&nbsp;społeczności psiaków. Czyli praktykują <i>puppy play</i>, zakładają maski psiaków, integrują się na&nbsp;wspólnych zjazdach, noszą ogonki i&nbsp;w&nbsp;takich przebraniach pojawiają się także na&nbsp;marszach równości. Łączy się to&nbsp;z&nbsp;szeroko rozumianą praktyką troski, consentu, kinku, pleasure i&nbsp;bezpiecznego seksu. Te&nbsp;zdjęcia przedstawiały półnagich mężczyzn, ale&nbsp;od&nbsp;rozpoczęcia wystawy zaczęła się na&nbsp;nas medialna nagonka. Wystawę komentował ówczesny minister edukacji, że&nbsp;za&nbsp;pieniądze publiczne promowane jest zboczenie, pojawiło się też sporo obrzydliwych komentarzy w&nbsp;lokalnych mediach. Skutek był taki, że&nbsp;na&nbsp;wystawę przyszło jakieś pięćset osób, w&nbsp;tym takie, które bez&nbsp;tej&nbsp;burzy nigdy by&nbsp;do&nbsp;nas nie&nbsp;trafiły. Miałem wtedy okazję być na&nbsp;tej&nbsp;wystawie codziennie i&nbsp;po&nbsp;niej oprowadzać, była to&nbsp;świetna okazja, by&nbsp;krytycznie porozmawiać o&nbsp;tym, co&nbsp;te&nbsp;osoby słyszały, a&nbsp;jak rzeczywiście jest, i&nbsp;spotkać się w&nbsp;miejscu pomiędzy. Nasi goście zrozumieli, że&nbsp;w&nbsp;sumie nie&nbsp;jest tak, jak to&nbsp;im&nbsp;zostało przedstawione, że&nbsp;nastawiali się na&nbsp;zboczenie i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;zobaczyli tego, a&nbsp;pewna starsza pani nawet stwierdziła, że&nbsp;w&nbsp;sumie fajne te&nbsp;psiaki i&nbsp;jest jeden na&nbsp;każdy dzień tygodnia. Myślę, że&nbsp;to&nbsp;ważne, żeby&nbsp;potrafić słuchać się wzajemnie, pomimo różnych zdań. Uczymy się razem żyć. To, że&nbsp;mamy różne opinie, nie&nbsp;oznacza, że&nbsp;musimy wnosić w&nbsp;świat nienawiść.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jak byście zdefiniowali moment, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;jesteście teraz jako osoby współtworzące Słonecznik, Klub Antykryzysowy czy&nbsp;Bibliotekę Azyl?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG:</b> Ze&nbsp;Słonecznika wyszedłem jakiś czas temu, ze&nbsp;względu na&nbsp;inne obowiązki. Jestem także kierownikiem Centrum Społeczności Romskiej i&nbsp;poza animacją tej&nbsp;społeczności oraz&nbsp;tworzeniem programu centrum tworzę także miejsce w&nbsp;instytucjach zewnętrznych. Romowie to&nbsp;kolejny duży i&nbsp;smutny temat w&nbsp;kontekście wykluczenia różnych społeczności w&nbsp;obiegu kulturalnym. Do&nbsp;tego dochodzi Klub Antykryzysowy i&nbsp;studia. Jeśli chodzi o&nbsp;moment, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;się znajduję, to&nbsp;jest to&nbsp;moment świętego spokoju. Obserwując, co&nbsp;się dzieje na&nbsp;zewnątrz naszej artystycznej bańki, mam poczucie, że&nbsp;to, co&nbsp;robię, jest potrzebne i&nbsp;ważne. Jestem też nastawiony bojowo, bo&nbsp;na&nbsp;pewno czeka mnie dużo pracy.</p>\n\t\n\n\n<p><b>FK:</b> Ja&nbsp;teraz też trochę oddalam się od&nbsp;Biblioteki Azyl, jestem raczej za&nbsp;kulisami. Pierwsze trzy i&nbsp;pół roku Azylu było o&nbsp;powołaniu projektu do&nbsp;życia, stworzeniu stałych struktur, a&nbsp;teraz mogę przekazać swoje obowiązki innym, osobom, które chcą się czegoś nauczyć. Jesteśmy też w&nbsp;momencie negocjacji z&nbsp;galerią Labirynt skali wsparcia finansowego dla nas, bo&nbsp;w&nbsp;tym roku zrezygnowałem z&nbsp;pisania grantów, nie&nbsp;mam na&nbsp;to&nbsp;przestrzeni. A&nbsp;wsparcie, także finansowe, jest potrzebne, żeby&nbsp;stworzona w&nbsp;Bibliotece Azyl struktura nie&nbsp;zgasła. Zależy mi&nbsp;na&nbsp;tym, żeby&nbsp;Azyl pozostał w&nbsp;Lublinie i&nbsp;służył lokalnej społeczności.</p>\n<h6><span>Socjolożka Natalia Sarata przypomina nam, że&nbsp;„sojuszniczenie” to&nbsp;czasownik. A&nbsp;cytując jeden ze&nbsp;spektakli Komuny Warszawa: „Brak zaangażowania w&nbsp;praktykę wytwarza teoretyczne halucynacje”.</span></h6>\n<blockquote><p>Gdybyście mieli sformułować krótkie przesłanie dla polskich instytucji sztuki i&nbsp;kultury, to&nbsp;jakby ono brzmiało?</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>TG:</b> Mniej pozerstwa, więcej szczerości. A&nbsp;tak&nbsp;na&nbsp;serio, to&nbsp;warto, żeby&nbsp;instytucje interesowały się społecznościami, które są&nbsp;obok, i&nbsp;nie&nbsp;bały się sięgać po&nbsp;narzędzia do&nbsp;integracji. Ale&nbsp;także dbały same o&nbsp;siebie, bo&nbsp;jak wiemy, osoby pracujące w&nbsp;instytucjach często są&nbsp;wypalone, mają swoje problemy i&nbsp;muszą się z&nbsp;nimi mierzyć. I&nbsp;to&nbsp;jest coś, co&nbsp;we&nbsp;współpracy z&nbsp;instytucjami trzeba uwzględniać w&nbsp;szukaniu wspólnych rozwiązań. Trzeba dawać sygnały, że&nbsp;jesteśmy empatyczni i&nbsp;rozumiemy ich sytuację.</p>\n<p><b>FK:</b> Socjolożka Natalia Sarata przypomina nam, że&nbsp;„sojuszniczenie” to&nbsp;czasownik. Wymaga ono działania, ale&nbsp;także uczestniczenia. Zachęcam pracowników instytucji, przy których&nbsp;dzieje się jakaś inicjatywa angażująca lokalną społeczność, żeby&nbsp;na&nbsp;jedno z&nbsp;jej wydarzeń przyjść, zobaczyć jak te&nbsp;spotkania wyglądają i&nbsp;co&nbsp;wytwarzają. Teraz niestety często bywa tak, że&nbsp;osoby pomagające w&nbsp;realizacji projektu – np.&nbsp;zajmujące się jego promocją w&nbsp;mediach, osoby z&nbsp;działów edukacji, albo&nbsp;nawet osoby dyrektorskie – nie&nbsp;zawsze są&nbsp;obecne na&nbsp;tych wydarzeniach. Oczywiście, często jest to&nbsp;spowodowane brakiem czasu. Nie&nbsp;mam tu&nbsp;na&nbsp;myśli akurat Labiryntu, bo&nbsp;osoby pracujące tam często przychodzą na&nbsp;wernisaże wystaw organizowanych w&nbsp;Azylu. Cieszy mnie to, bo, cytując jeden ze&nbsp;spektakli Komuny Warszawa: „Brak zaangażowania w&nbsp;praktykę wytwarza teoretyczne halucynacje”. Dlatego zapraszam osoby z&nbsp;instytucji do&nbsp;odwiedzania i&nbsp;uczestniczenia, w&nbsp;miarę swoich możliwości, w&nbsp;projektach, które dzieją się obok nich.

If you’d asked me recently whether Kurt Vonnegut’s novel “<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breakfast-Champions-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385334206\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Breakfast-Champions-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385334206&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breakfast-Champions-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385334206\">Breakfast of Champions</a>,” from 1973, had been adapted for a movie, I’d have scoffed that anyone would be foolhardy enough to try to film such a metafictional, intertextual, phantasmagorical whizbang. Imagine my surprise to find that the movie exists, came out in 1999 (before I was reviewing films), and my gleeful shock to learn that it was written and directed by Alan Rudolph, one of my favorite living directors. On the other hand, I also figured out why I never heard of it at the time of its release: it was a flop, with a total box-office take of $178,278 (on a twelve-million-dollar budget). Unsurprisingly, the critics were complicit in its failure: it’s deep underwater on Rotten Tomatoes, which lists reviews disdaining it as “unwatchable,” “tasteless,” and “boring.” (<em>The New Yorker</em> merely ignored it.)</p><div data-testid=\"NewsletterSubscribeFormWrapper\" data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\"><h3>Get <i>The New Yorker’s</i> daily newsletter</h3><p>Keep up with everything we offer, plus exclusives available only to newsletter readers, directly in your in-box.</p></div></div></article><div data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ContentFooter&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ContentFooter&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\"><div data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Contributors&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Contributors&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"><p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody\"><span><picture><source sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b758b51cf59fc423c61/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b758b51cf59fc423c61/1:1/w_240,c_limit/undefined 240w\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"><source sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b758b51cf59fc423c61/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b758b51cf59fc423c61/1:1/w_240,c_limit/undefined 240w\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\"><img src=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b758b51cf59fc423c61/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/undefined\" alt=\"\"></picture></span></a></p></div><div data-testid=\"ContentFooterBottom\"><div data-testid=\"NewsletterSubscribeFormWrapper\" data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\"><h3>Get <i>The New Yorker’s</i> daily newsletter</h3><p>Keep up with everything we offer, plus exclusives available only to newsletter readers, directly in your in-box.</p></div><div data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;RecircList&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;RecircList&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-testid=\"RowWrapper\" data-attr-viewport-monitor=\"\"><p data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;SectionTitle&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;SectionTitle&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-testid=\"SectionTitle\"><header>Read More</header></p><div data-testid=\"SummaryCollectionGridItems\"><div data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;SummaryItem&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;SummaryItem&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-item=\"{&quot;dangerousHed&quot;:&quot;What if the Attention Crisis Is All a Distraction?&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:0,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;venue&quot;,&quot;hotelLink&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/27/the-sirens-call-chris-hayes-book-review#intcid=_the-new-yorker-article-bottom-recirc_c6861fbb-6f08-4c9a-9f9d-48c00037d7be_roberta-similarity1_fallback_popular4-1&quot;,&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;GridFourColumns&quot;}\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/27/the-sirens-call-chris-hayes-book-review#intcid=_the-new-yorker-article-bottom-recirc_c6861fbb-6f08-4c9a-9f9d-48c00037d7be_roberta-similarity1_fallback_popular4-1\" data-recirc-pattern=\"summary-item\" data-recirc-id=\"item-hed-1\" data-component-type=\"recirc-river\"><p>What if the Attention Crisis Is All a Distraction?</p></a><p>From the pianoforte to the smartphone, each wave of tech has sparked fears of brain rot.

Google results are stuffed with search-optimized spam, unhelpful advertisements, and AI slop. Amazon has become littered with undifferentiated <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/why-does-it-feel-like-amazon-is-making-itself-worse.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">junk</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/mark-zuckerberg-wants-be-elon-musk/681248/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">state</a> of social media, meanwhile—fractured, disorienting, and prone to boosting all manner of misinformation—can be succinctly described as a cesspool.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It’s with some irony, then, that Reddit has become a reservoir of humanity. The platform has itself been called a cesspool, rife with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">hateful</a> rhetoric and falsehoods. But it is also known for quirky discussions and impassioned debates on any topic among its users. Does <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i8hm7c/aita_for_charging_my_brother_rent_to_stay_in_my/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">charging</a> your brother rent, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gh9r7z/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_was_an_unwanted_guest/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">telling your mom</a> she’s an unwanted guest, or giving your wife a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110sa1h/aita_for_giving_my_sahm_wife_a_written/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">performance review</a> make you an asshole? (Redditors voted no, yes, and “everyone sucks,” respectively.) The site is where fans hash out the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantanoforever/comments/16io9yz/what_is_the_best_rap_album_of_all_time/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">best</a> rap album ever and plumbers weigh in on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1c314u/lpt_unclog_your_drain_the_natural_and_cheap_way/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">how to unclog</a> a drain. As Google has begun to offer more and more vacuous SEO sites and ads in response to queries, many people have started adding <em>reddit</em> to their searches to find thoughtful, human-written answers: <em>find mosquito in bedroom reddit</em>; <em>fix musty sponge reddit</em>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But now even Reddit is becoming more artificial. The platform has quietly started beta-testing Reddit Answers, what it <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/blog/introducing-reddit-answers\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">calls</a> an “AI-powered conversational interface.” In function and design, the feature—which is so far available only for some users in the U.S.—is basically an AI chatbot. On a new search screen accessible from the homepage, Reddit Answers takes anyone’s queries, trawls the site for relevant discussions and debates, and composes them into a response. In other words, a site that <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">sells</a> itself as a home for “authentic human connection” is now giving humans the option to interact with an algorithm instead.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The company <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/blog/introducing-reddit-answers\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">announced</a> the feature last month as an improved “search experience” that pulls “information … from real conversations and communities across all of Reddit.” Reddit Answers includes links to those conversations, which users are free to click, read, and comment on. Even so, using Reddit Answers is a demoralizing experience. It’s streamlined, yes: The AI responds to questions in bulleted lists, with bold headings followed by summaries of and brief quotes from actual Reddit discussions. But these answers lose the messy, endearing excess of any good Reddit thread. They appear like takeaways instead of teasers, final answers instead of entry points for <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/ai-search-engines-curiosity/680594/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">further discovery</a>; you are unlikely to fall down a rabbit hole of posts from here. Nor are you encouraged to unfurl a thread of people debating, reviewing, and building upon legitimately useful advice. Instead of a Redditor, you feel like you’re just here to peck meat off some bones.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Consider, for example, requesting tips for traveling with a baby on an airplane. Reddit Answers generates a list of ideas—perhaps “Pack Essentials” or “Board Early”—decontextualized from the parents who gathered this wisdom, the horrifying and hilarious anecdotes in their original posts, and the heartwarming support and tips in additional responses. Perhaps the greatest value of a good Reddit thread is the informed disagreement on best purchases and practices—what <em>really</em> were the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1aoocbq/my_testing_of_the_top_earbuds_of_2024/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">best earbuds of 2024</a>, and for what reasons. The chatbot’s bulleted summaries steamroll that back-and-forth. The AI answer isn’t even clearly more efficient or useful than reading answers yourself. Aside from the specificity, caveats, and elaboration unique to human conversations, many Redditors already format their responses in digestible lists. (In one thread asking for tips for flying with a baby, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/x4tdqh/what_you_wish_you_knewflying_with_baby_advice/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">the top comment</a> is a list in which every other bullet reads “snacks.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">For less pragmatic matters, it’s hard to imagine any advantage to using Reddit’s AI. Asking the chatbot for music recommendations will return a boring, unwieldy list. The Reddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1i1czin/whats_a_dead_giveaway_someone_grew_up_as_an_only/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">thread</a> “What’s a dead giveaway someone grew up as an only child?” has some fantastic responses—doesn’t immediately know which half of a sliced cake is bigger, can’t roughhouse, leaves rooms without announcing where they are going—while the AI answers are bland: “Difficulty Sharing,” “Difficulty in Relationships.” Why would I ask an AI about the odds that the New York Mets re-sign Pete Alonso, what makes focaccia in Liguria special, or the annoying thing about transplants to New York City? Reddit, for its part, seems to understand the limitations: When I reached out to ask about this product, a spokesperson told me over email that in part, “Answers simply summarizes redditors’ existing posts and conversations without presenting an opinion or perspective of its own” and directs users to relevant discussions.</p><section data-event-module=\"recirc\" data-flatplan-ignore=\"true\"><h2>Recommended Reading</h2><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The site exists as it always has outside of Reddit Answers, but the embrace of generative AI feels foreboding. This is a trend across much of the digital and now even physical worlds, as tech companies stuff the technology into apps, smartphones, and glasses. AI can legitimately make life easier—helping more quickly summarize complex topics, write computer code, or edit photos, for instance. But many applications of AI remain limited and frequently superfluous. Google, instead of organizing humanmade information, is blending the web through frequently <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/google-search-ai-overview-health-webmd/678508/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">flawed</a> “AI Overviews.” Apple is touting an Apple Intelligence service that has sent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge93de21n0o\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">fake-news alerts</a> (a problem that the company solved by temporarily <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/technology/apple-ai-news-notifications.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">turning off</a> this part of the feature altogether) and that strip-mines texts into “lifeless summaries,” as my colleague Lila Shroff <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/apple-intelligence-text-messages/680717/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">noted</a>. Mikey Shulman, the CEO of Suno, an AI music start-up, recently <a href=\"https://futurism.com/suno-ai-ceo-making-music\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">said</a> that making music is “not really enjoyable”—his product can do that work instead. Algorithms, instead of helping bring you to humans, are being pitched as the web’s start, middle, and end point.</p><p data-event-position=\"1\" data-event-element=\"injected link\" data-view-action=\"view link - injected link - item 1\" id=\"injected-recirculation-link-0\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/apple-intelligence-text-messages/680717/\">Read: Apple lost the plot on texting</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">All of these generative-AI applications, of course, are only as good as the content they draw from. (Reddit has long been prized as a trove of high-quality AI-training data.) Without human answers, there is no Reddit Answers—and so, should the feature really take off and Redditors stop engaging with one another, the chatbot will be drained of biological intelligence, and soul as well. It’s the same with any AI tool seeking to synthesize, summarize, and boil portions of the web down to their essence: Eventually, the pot will burn dry.</p></section><div data-event-module=\"footer\"><p><h3>About the Author</h3></p><div><address data-flatplan-bio=\"true\" data-event-position=\"1\" data-event-element=\"author\" id=\"article-writer-0\"><div><div><p><a data-event-element=\"image\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matteo-wong/\"><img height=\"60\" width=\"60\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cvqkiGqr5oeTvJi706qtcaOkivk=/815x349:3584x3118/120x120/media/img/authors/2023/06/Matteo_Wong/original.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></a></p></div><div><p><a data-action=\"click author - name\" data-label=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matteo-wong/\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matteo-wong/\">Matteo Wong</a> is a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p></div></div></address></div></div></article></div></div>",

            "htmlContent": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p><strong>LAS VEGAS —</strong> There is something unstable at the most basic level about any space with too much capitalism happening in it. The air is all wrong, there's simultaneously too much in it and not enough of it. Everyone I spoke to about the Consumer Electronics Show before I went to it earlier this month kept describing it in terms that involved wetness in some way. I took this as a warning, which I believe was the spirit in which it was intended, but I felt prepared for it. Your classically damp commercial experiences have a sort of <em>terroir</em> to them, a signature that marks a confluence of circumstances and time- and place-specific appetites; I have carried with me for decades the peculiar smell, less that of cigarette smoke than cigarette smoke <em>in hair</em>, that I remember from a baseball card show at a Ramada Inn that I attended as a kid. Only that particular strain of that particular kind of commerce, at that moment, gave off that specific distress signal. It was the smell of a living thing, and the dampness in the (again, quite damp) room was in part because that thing was breathing, heavily.</p><p>CES, which this year claimed 141,000 attendees and 4,500 exhibitors, could on the other hand have been anywhere, or everywhere. That it was held across several vast convention spaces in Las Vegas certainly helped with that placelessness, or everyplacefulness, but the overwhelming volume and scale of the thing ensured it. The air in every space was charged with all that commerce, somehow shortened by the competition for it, but it wasn't close in the ways that I had prepared myself for. </p><p>Instead, the experience felt oddly distant even when and where it was crowded. On the bus taking attendees from the hotel that hosted CES to the parts of it at the Las Vegas Convention Center, people blithely joined Zoom calls and talked about \"deep partnerships\" in competition with a recording that played, over and over, in English and then in Spanish, warning people not to stand in the rear door. Conversations between lanyard-draped coworkers rustled under all that in various languages; the only word I could identify with any certainty from those was \"Covid.\" The show itself was sometimes loud and sometimes quiet, seldom linear and never embarrassed, shabby or grand from one booth and one moment to the next, but for the most part it stubbornly refused to cohere. The overwhelming theme, which various attendees I talked to said was basically a rerun of the previous year's version, amounted to turning your life over, bit by bit and moment by moment, to artificial intelligence technology that would do ever larger amounts of that living for you.</p><p>The Tesla-branded Hyperloop that moved attendees around the sprawling convention center feels like the apotheosis of something or other—mass transit made dumb and inefficient through its insistent refusal to honor the concept; a futuristic aesthetic gone janky around the edges, in service of a howling and willful category error; neither a solution nor quite a problem, but more a strange and showboat-y rephrasing of the question. I wrote in my notebook, from the front seat of a silent Tesla carrying me, its driver, and one other person through a pastel-toned tunnel, that \"nothing can prepare you for how fucking stupid this shit is.\" But I think even a few hours at CES actually did a pretty good job of that.</p><hr><p>\"I don't know exactly when it'll come,\" the AI CEO <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dario Amodei said</a> last week, in Davos. \"I don't know if it'll be 2027. I think it's plausible it could be longer than that. I don't think it will be a whole bunch longer than that when AI systems are better than humans at almost everything. Better than almost all humans at almost everything. And then eventually better than all humans at everything.\"</p><p>AI executives love saying stuff like this, but they are not just saying it for their own pleasure. They're selling, of course, but also this grandiose and mystified mixture of awe and dread—something amazing is happening very quickly just out of sight, and will be here soon despite always being exactly 18-36 months away, and you will need to be protected from it, but also it will improve your life—is as much the product as anything else. It is pitched less at the general public, to whom it might reasonably sound like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(Saw_character)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Jigsaw Killer</a> explaining why he had placed a bear trap on their head, than at the investors and politicians whose faith keeps the industry afloat. Those dire promises will stand in for the product until such time as there is a product worth selling; the speculative stuff will continue either way.</p><p>The tech industry has cycled with increasing speed over the last few years through a number of boomlets and bubbles that were sold in the same way—a new virtual world in which we will all live and play and flourish and mostly go to meetings, accessible through <a href=\"https://defector.com/facebook-meta-asks-wouldnt-it-be-nice-to-die\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">some sort of wearable technology</a> or suite of <a href=\"https://defector.com/cryptocurrency-bad-and-weird\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">carbon-intensive gimmicks</a>, and within which all the same people and companies will be exactly as in charge as they are in this one. Everyone will be there, albeit remotely; somehow only the same few creeps ever showed up.</p><p>The comparison between AI and true-blue boondoggles like the Metaverse is admittedly not entirely fair. There really are some useful applications for machine learning, although none of those are big enough to justify the scale that the companies pushing AI are seeking and, crucially, none of them are the things that those companies have made central to their products, which mostly produce flabby, haplessly uncanny dross. At this moment, there is just not much positive public-facing utility or appeal to much that AI does—it's a way to automate various online annoyances; a low-effort homework-evasion tool; a way to make different kinds of stuff, all of which suck, at industrial scale and with industrial-scale externalities. Its most practical use-case remains Doing Crimes.</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px\" srcset=\"https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w\" src=\"https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2192554946.jpg?w=710\" alt=\"A bunch of people taking photos of a robot dog at CES in Las Vegas.\"><figcaption><span>A robot dog and its admirers. </span><span></span><span>Photo by Zeng Hui/Xinhua via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is nothing much to sell yet, is the problem. New iterations of these companies' signature products are reliably bad; that any of it might someday become something different, not even along the lines of Amodei's darkly fanciful Creating Humanity 2.0 gambit but just as a thing that actually does what it purports to do, is all there is to market. The idea of a machine that thinks and feels and cares has fascinated and tantalized and frightened and titillated humans for as long as we've had technology, and that plus the familiar cultural deference given to things that are large, rich, and loud has created an oddly abstracted discourse around AI—one that is extremely attentive to all its promised possibilities and pathologically patient with the goofy results that repeatedly surface instead.</p><p>It's deranging, but in a familiar way. The industry's leading powers say ridiculous things, the people whose job it is to report on the industry repeat them, and everyone downstream is left to reconcile the distance and rationalize the difference between those soaring possibilities and the reliably shabby fact of the thing. For bosses, to whom a great deal of this technology is being marketed, the choice is between deploying a <a href=\"https://futurism.com/first-ai-software-engineer-devin-bungling-tasks?utm_campaign=defector&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">technology that bungles even relatively simple tasks</a> or continuing to entrust that work to people who are much likelier to do it correctly, but who will also periodically need to go to the doctor or just to bed; whether AI ever gets \"better than\" humans at any of these things matters less to this audience than how quickly it might become acceptably bad, and both matter much less than the speculative economy surrounding it. On the user end of things, at the moment, the choice is either to offer that objectively scammy reality either some qualified credit or to avoid it to the extent possible.</p><p>Some percentage of those users will simply accept that this is already magic, because they are inclined to believe or easily impressed or just because it is more fun to believe that than not. Some other percentage will see the lapse between what is promised and what is delivered and feel, understandably, like they are being lied to. The people covering this technology, by and large, have remained very polite about it all. \"If your question is 'what can Operator do better than existing tools?' the answer is not clear,\" <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/openai-operator-ai-agent-hands-on/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Platformer's Casey Newton wrote</a> about OpenAI's new \"agent\" product. \"It&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;take action on your behalf in ways that are new to AI systems—but at the moment it requires a lot of hand-holding, and may cause you to throw up your hands in frustration.\" This assessment gets more complicated when Newton explains what those actions were:</p><blockquote><p>My most frustrating experience with Operator was my first one: trying to order groceries. “Help me buy groceries on Instacart,” I said, expecting it to ask me some basic questions. Where do I live? What store do I usually buy groceries from? What kinds of groceries do I want?&nbsp;</p><p>It didn’t ask me any of that. Instead, Operator opened Instacart in the browser tab and begin searching for milk in grocery stores located in Des Moines, Iowa.&nbsp;</p><p>At that point, I told Operator to buy groceries from my local grocery store in San Francisco. Operator then tried to enter my local grocery store’s address as my&nbsp;<em>delivery</em>&nbsp;address.&nbsp;<br></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Newton ultimately had to take over and do the work himself. \"In the end,\" he writes, \"adding six bananas, a 12-pack of seltzer, and a package of raspberries to a cart had taken me 15 minutes.\" This is worth mentioning because the biggest companies at CES were all pushing the idea that technology like this—well, not like <em>this</em>, but a notional version of it that actually works—will usher in a new way to live. The technology currently lavishly fucking up your grocery order in a supervised setting will soon make you breakfast and drive you to work and help raise your child and manage both your glucose levels and those of your pet. It will know everything about you, and it will also care about you. At CES, the Korean tech giant LG called their version of this Affectionate Intelligence, which will allow users to \"experience affectionate moments\" on the road or in their smart home, thanks to a technology that \"truly gets you and manages your life with care.\" This will leave you more time in which to, uh.</p><hr><p>Climbing the food chain at CES was an escalating process of getting lost. This was a very big show, and not all of it was aimed at the general public. A whole floor of the Las Vegas Convention Center's South Hall was given over to the white-label electronics brands whose products dominate Amazon searches, and that floor was silent and strange and mostly empty of pedestrian traffic when I visited. There was nothing but business to be done up there, bulk orders to be placed for USB cables or smartphone cases or headphones or whatever with companies whose names were designed to be forgotten—Marvo Business Group, Soonleader, Shenzen EarFun. A man stepped out of one of these booths, silently handed me a fun-size Milky Way, and then retreated back into it.</p><p>The problem that these companies are solving is easy to grasp. It was occasionally uncanny in how it presented itself—downstairs and elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tale-of-four-kodaks-173040742.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as Daniel Cooper noted</a> at Engadget, were <em>four</em> different concerns advertising different products under the Kodak brand, all of which held some of the 1,100 patents that company sold off as part of its bankruptcy in 2012. There was also a company selling e-bikes and scooters under the old Memorex trademark; the people in Radio Shack polo shirts in the Radio Shack booth were not representatives of the bankrupt American franchise but the familiars of a zombie brand <a href=\"https://grupounicomer.com/en/we-strengthen-our-operations-in-south-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">now owned by the El Salvador-based Unicomer group</a>. But, Cooper wrote, it was also more or less what it looked like: \"nothing more than names and logos slapped on products that are shipped in from various manufacturers.\"</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px\" srcset=\"https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w\" src=\"https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-2193563193.jpg?w=710\" alt=\"JaVale McGee taking a selfie of himself with a lollipop of some kind in his mouth and some kind of headphone thing on his head at CES.\"><figcaption><span>JaVale McGee was there. </span><span></span><span>Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was supply rising to meet a global demand, businesses whose success or failure will, just given how the internet works now, necessarily have less to do with quality or coherent brand identity than with cheaply and quickly addressing some need. \"I once loved Memorex's VHS tapes, so I will now buy this Memorex e-scooter,\" is on the merits an absurd value proposition, but not much more or less absurd than anything else in that space. These are real businesses, but in this ecosystem they are effectively plankton—small organisms that are integral to the broader system's survival and mostly food.</p><p>More legible were the booths that featured products with more obvious uses. If the Marvo-EarFun tranche exists to fill an unreasoning appetite for \"earbuds, any kind, immediately,\" these were answers to more discrete problems. The solution to \"I do not have a soft-serve ice cream machine in my home but would like to\" weighs 76 pounds, costs about $3,000, works a bit like a Keurig coffee machine, and is made in Tom Glavine's Massachusetts hometown. (The ice cream was good; if basically everything about my life was different, I'd want one.) The solution to \"I want a pet door that only opens for my dog, and not for burglars or possums\" was smart, smartly presented, and made of aircraft-grade aluminum that withstood hundreds of blows from a sledgehammer in the company's booth without any visible dents. Not all of these problems were what you might call urgent, or even what you might call problems: A woman working in the booth for a sex toy manufacturer caught me looking at a Fleshlight-style device moving up and down on an arm synched, she told me, \"to whatever you're watching,\" which in this case was a video playing on a laptop of a smiling woman bouncing on a trampoline. \"Usually,\" she explained, \"the device would be set up the other way,\" meaning with the aperture facing down. I don't remember what I said in response.</p><p>These were <em>things</em>, in short, and in this superheated context they were comforting in their legibility. It became more abstract further up the food chain. It is one thing for some concern or other to try to gamify masturbation—the game was called Fappy Bunny, it was \"powered by Fluffer,\" and I do not want to talk about it—or disrupt the gaming chair space, and quite another to meet investors' grandiose ambitions. Practical technologies tended to emphasize impractical and fantastical potential uses that scale-obsessed investors might care more about: Wearable accessibility tech that allows people without the use of their arms or legs to use a computer through small facial gestures was talked up as a hands-free retail tool; a home saliva-testing kit that could be of use for trans people doing DIY hormone therapy was instead pitched more or less at that one unsettling rich guy who is trying to age in reverse. The fantasy of growth, on the metastatic scale that investors demand, outstrips every other concern. Even the most miraculous plowshare must have some potential utility as a sword.</p><p>At the top, there was more abstraction than anything else. Big corporations necessarily deal in more abstruse problems and more elaborate solutions, and tell different stories. The challenge for them is that there are only so many plausible or even passably appealing Whole New Ways To Watch Television, regardless of how much better the screens get. That those screens really are getting a lot better only means so much; at this level, the work is not solving any particular problem but consolidating a suite of overarching semi-solutions around all of them. This gambit inevitably bumps up against the outer boundaries of the possible in terms of individual solutions to structural problems: Even a notional future AI assistant—one that can do the things contemporary ones can't, one that Truly Gets You—can only do so much about poorly designed or badly maintained public spaces. The worldview that gave us the Hyperloop does not have solutions to any of that; ideologically, and just at a more elemental level, it doesn't believe in them.</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px\" srcset=\"https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w\" src=\"https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/20250109_101542.jpg?w=710\" alt=\"A mannequin kind of freestyling on a unicycle type thing in front of a sign that reads Unlock Immersive Meetings at the 2025 CES.\"><figcaption><span>Nothing more extreme than unlocking immersive meetings. </span><span></span><span>David Roth/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>Consider the problems that, taken altogether, add up to our shameful and unworkable political moment. It's the abandonment of <a href=\"https://defector.com/beyond-belief\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not just any sense of a common cause but a workable consensus reality</a>; it's the swamping of any collective effort or any nascent social consciousness in favor of individuals assiduously optimizing and competing and refining and selling themselves, not so much alongside the rest of humanity as in constant competition with all of it; it's the rich buffing all human friction from every aspect of their days so that they can more cleanly and passively move through them, a circuit of Teslas circling silently underground forever; it's everyone else, somewhere offscreen, leaving whatever those restless protagonists have ordered on the doorstep and getting tipped 10 percent for it; it's <a href=\"https://defector.com/the-hawk-tuah-memecoin-rug-pull-is-the-apotheosis-of-bag-culture\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an efflorescence of dead-eyed scams</a> and ever taller fences. The fantasy and utility of AI, for the unconscionably wealthy and relentlessly wary masters of this space, converge in a high and lonesome abstraction—technology designed less to do every human thing for you than to replace all those human things with itself, and then sell that function back to you as a monthly subscription. This device will play with and talk to your child; this furry mouthless robot with enormous attentive eyes will replace your pet; your coffee is ready and your clothes for the day have been picked out for you.</p><p>It is both the nature and the business of casinos to make the outside world disappear, but there was a greater recession at work here—all these miracles and potential miracles worked to push users into the same stilted and solitary prisons of ease. Steve Jobs's belief that people don't know what they want until it is shown to them has long been a catechism in this cohort; Silicon Valley types have spent nearly two decades now showing people things they mostly do not want and insisting that they actually want it. If there is anything new about Silicon Valley's triumphal AI push, it is the extent to which its exponents are no longer asking whether anyone wants what they're selling and simply asserting its inevitability. \"A world in which human wages crash due to AI—logically, necessarily—is a world in which productivity goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero,\" the reactionary venture capitalist Marc Andreessen <a href=\"https://x.com/pmarca/status/1882993091784880557\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tweeted last Friday</a>. \"Consumer cornucopia.\"</p><p>The familiar Jobs-ian notes of wonder and inspiration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/opinion/ai-chatgpt-empower-bot.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just do not sound very convincing</a> coming from this notably less visionary cohort, both because they seem so ignorant about what people actually like to do and because their answer to that is flubby and mediocre surveillance technologies whose only promise to users is an ever more optimized and atomized self. At any rate, the offer is clear: In exchange for self-determination or dignity or privacy or agency, you will be granted airless post-human convenience mediated and enforced by proprietary algorithms that currently do not work, on a pay-to-play basis. The immediate circumstances of the AI industry changed dramatically for its incumbent powers just days after Andreessen's post <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/deepseek-mania-shakes-ai-industry-to-its-core/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">due to the furor around the Chinese AI technology DeepSeek</a>, whose success raised the question of whether you actually need <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41\">$500 billion worth of infrastructure and world-historic energy consumption</a> in order to make a fun little tool that can summarize emails. Still, the fundamental terms of the industry's offer remain the same. It's not a negotiation; they are not asking. But.</p><p>There is another way to read this, though, which is as a tapped-out super-class attempting to rush its preferred future into existence in the absence of any broader justification or appetite for any of it. It is rich cynics trying to make something lifeless grow in the way that living things do, and lock in the dying present they rule for the foreseeable future by effectively removing everyone from it but them. They are impatient not just because they are high-handed and avaricious, but because they know that the only future they can rule in the way they want is one that is passive, stupid, small and shrinking. There is in this morbid turning inward a latent and terribly sad admission of defeat—it is a future you'd accept only if you had given up on every other richer and more human and more generous one. The only people who've actually chosen it, so far, are the ones insisting that there's no other future to choose.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>",

Maybe you’ve made some sales and gotten some recognition, but you can’t help feeling that you’re still behind. Everyone else seems to have more — followers, opportunities, time. They seem to have it all figured out. It’s starting to feel like there will never be enough money, connections, or recognition to give you the stability and success you’re looking for as an artist.</p>\n\n<p>If this feels familiar, and it’s a common feeling for many creative people, you are experiencing the pangs of <strong>scarcity mindset</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I first got obsessed with this topic after reading Jessica Abel’s great writing on scarcity, and later, the research of Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldir Shafir in their book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scarcity-Having-Little-Means-Much-ebook/dp/B00BMKOO6S\">Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much</a></em>. This led me down an incredible rabbit hole, where I discovered how artists are particularly vulnerable to this way of thinking. I started to observe my own behavior and realize I was often working from a place of lack, <strong>believing that what I was seeking was in limited supply</strong>. I was moving from task to task like a chicken with my head cut off, always feeling like I was catching up. I realized that if I was going to find stability (and some peace of mind) in my life as an artist, I was going to need to change my approach.</p>\n\n<p>In my work as a teacher and coach, I started talking about these ideas in public. I now bring artists together to discuss how this feeling of lack impacts creative communities. I offer tools we can all use to start changing the way we think, work, and collaborate — to see beyond what we lack, and recognize the abundance that’s often right in front of us.</p>\n\n<p>Below is my guide to understanding scarcity mindset — what it is, how it affects us, and steps we can take to see more opportunity and potential in our creative lives.</p>\n\n<p>— Christine Garvey, artist and coach</p>\n\n      </section><section>\n      \n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-scarcity-mindset\"><a name=\"what\">What is scarcity mindset?</a></h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps you’ve heard of scarcity mindset before, but didn’t quite know what it was or why it’s so toxic. Here’s a definition:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scarcity mindset is the state of believing that what you want is in limited supply. That you will never have enough of that thing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You could have this feeling around money, time, connections, status, or security. If you experience scarcity around connection, you feel lonely. If you experience scarcity around status, you feel undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>This is a common experience for many of us, and it turns out our brains are doing some interesting things when we feel something is scarce. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity:_Why_Having_Too_Little_Means_So_Much\">the research</a> of Harvard economist Sendhil Mullainathan and Princeton psychologist Eldar Shafir, when we are in scarcity mindset, we do a few key things:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>We engage in “tunneling.”</strong> We get obsessed with the problem we are trying to solve. This could be manifesting an opportunity, getting more Instagram followers, or finishing a project.</p>\n\n<p>According to Mullainathan and Shafir, there are pros and cons to being in “the tunnel”:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The pros:</strong> We feel super focused and effective. We feel like we can accomplish anything. We make fewer mistakes with regard to what we’re “tunneling” on.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The cons:</strong> We engage in myopic thinking. We can’t see outside of the tunnel and have blinders on to everything else. We end up losing track of time, missing meetings, or are unable to see opportunities that are right in front of us.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2) <strong>We lose our bandwidth.</strong> You know that feeling of mental exhaustion when you’ve done too many things in one day? This is the experience of low bandwidth. Bandwidth is our fluid intelligence (ability to problem-solve) and our self control (ability to avoid impulsive decisions). When we feel scarce, these functions diminish significantly.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>We do trade-off thinking.</strong> When we’re in scarcity mindset, we think about things in an either/or vs. a this/and framework. The best way to understand this is through Mullainathan and Shafir’s use of the suitcase metaphor. Imagine you are packing a suitcase for a weekend getaway. If you’re experiencing scarcity mindset, you are working with a smaller suitcase. You can only pack so many things. You have to choose between bringing the extra t-shirt or the umbrella. If you’re working with an abundance mindset, you are using a bigger suitcase. With the big suitcase there is room for many possible opportunities, solutions, and outcomes.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"1_What_Is_Scarcity_Mindset.png\" src=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:2000/7fh8sSrZT3GrXeGxrkmz\">\n  \n    <figcaption>\n</figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-are-creative-people-so-vulnerable-to-this-kind-of-thinking\"><a name=\"why\">Why are creative people so vulnerable to this kind of thinking?</a></h2>\n\n<p><strong>We feel scarce in many different areas of our lives.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Time, money, status, security, respect. You name it, we’ve felt scarce around it. As artists, we are constantly having to advocate for our value — at work, in galleries, within academia, and in society at large. This sense of scarcity is reinforced by jobs that don’t provide healthcare and contract-based employment, leaving us to feel that security is in short supply. Or perhaps, if we have a full-time job with some security, we experience a scarcity of time for creative projects we care about. Basically, it’s easy to feel like we’re failing in many different arenas at a time. If we’re succeeding in one area, we’re catching up in another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creatives love the tunnel.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As Jessica Abel talks about in her blog post, <em><a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/scarcity-why-do-i-feel-like-im-trapped/\">If creativity is so freeing, why do I feel like I’m trapped?</a></em>, to us, being in the tunnel can feel equivalent to being in the flow. We pride ourselves on our ability to be in the zone. It makes us feel focused, powerful, and effective. This is how we were trained to work in school — to put in our hundred hours and get the work done. Turns out, this forge-ahead mindset is not always the best thing for our brains.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are always juggling.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most creative people are juggling many different things at a time. Maybe your juggle involves a day job, a studio practice, parenting, and grant writing. When we are juggling we are moving from one pressing task to the next. We are always “catching up” and feeling a step behind. This exacerbates the feeling of scarcity — the sense that we will never have enough time or energy.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"2_Why_Are_Creative_People_So_Vulnerable.png\" src=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:2000/Gtmaa6cvSkvtvYJGbYTA\">\n  \n    <figcaption>\n</figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-we-get-out-of-scarcity-mindset\"><a name=\"how\">How do we get out of scarcity mindset?</a></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Create an intentional relationship to the tunnel.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We need to examine our relationship to the scarcity mindset tunnel. What topics do we tunnel on? What happens when we tunnel? We need to create an intentional relationship to the tunnel so we can make our laser-focused way of working work <em>for</em> us instead of against us. This means we need to create ways to exit the tunnel when it’s time.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some tips for getting out of that obsessive, myopic, blinders-on way of working:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Set aside a specific amount of time for the task you need to get done.</strong> Writing a proposal? Working in the studio? Set an alarm for the amount of time you want to dedicate to that task, and when the alarm rings, stop working and shift gears.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Get an outside perspective from a collaborator, partner, coach, or stranger.</strong> It will give you context and help you identify what you’re not seeing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Get in your body.</strong> Frequently step away from what you’re doing. Eat lunch, go for a walk, take a shower, listen to music. This will help you remember that your brain lives in a body that needs some attention. Taking care of it will help you regain your bandwidth, restore your fluid intelligence, and get some fresh ideas back.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Examine where scarcity is reinforced in your life.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A great example of a system that reinforces scarcity mindset is social media. Social media wants you to feel scarce, because this is how it makes money. It wants you to feel like you’ll never have enough exotic vacations, cool shoes, qualifications, etc, so you go out and buy more of those things.</p>\n\n<p>Social media also makes it hard for you to connect with the things you really value. It puts all the people you’re following (your cousin, Cardi B, an artist you love, not to mention a random array of ads) into the same distribution stream, thus making it harder for you to remember what you actually care about and what’s driving you.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what, social media will make you feel scarce in some department of your life or another. So, use it as an instrument for advertising (i.e. to promote your work), which is what it’s built for, and minimize your relationship with it outside of this.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of social media, ask yourself: <strong>what other systems do you engage with that reinforce scarcity thinking?</strong> Is your work environment a place where you feel respect, security, and money are in limited supply? How is that being reinforced? Take a look at your environment and see if that’s impacted how you perceive what is available to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimize the juggle.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We can’t do it all. When we try to, we end up doing everything half-assed and feel like trash afterwards. It is essential that we minimize the juggling in our lives and focus on what is most important to us. <strong>Setting values-driven priorities is key to being effective and not getting stretched too thin.</strong> If this is particularly hard for you, here are some tools:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Use a <a href=\"http://alumni.sae.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/covey-time-management-grid.png\">priorities matrix</a> to figure out what to focus on, what to delegate, and what to leave behind.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Get a coach or accountability partner to help you recognize your values and set some goals.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Try this starter exercise: List everything you’re juggling (creative work, teaching, curatorial projects, parenting, etc.) and pick your top four most important areas of focus. Cut everything else away. This forces you to examine what’s important for you right now and set some goals in those areas.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"3_How_Do_We_get_out_of_scarcity.png\" src=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:2000/bKL3WTqRSDuyDzVSIS81\">\n  \n    <figcaption>\n</figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-we-start-feeling-abundant\"><a name=\"abundant\">How can we start feeling abundant?</a></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Get grateful.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gratitude is a deeply practical thing. Not only does it give you perspective and help you recognize all you can be thankful for, it also helps you <strong>identify how you are resourced</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are you grateful for your creative partner? \nResource: a person to bounce ideas off of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are you grateful for your studio? \nResource: a venue to make your work, share ideas, and connect with people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are you grateful for your cat? \nResource: a couch buddy who makes your home a happier place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you’re slipping into scarcity mindset, stop and get grateful. Make a list. Look at all the ways you are resourced: the support systems you have available to you and the places where you are already kicking ass.</p>\n\n<p>Getting grateful helps you flip the switch from “this is what I’m missing” to “look at everything I have.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recognize that opportunities are renewable resources.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When we are seeking opportunities for our work, it’s easy to fall prey to scarcity mindset. We can feel competitive, like what we want is in limited supply. We start thinking with the “small suitcase” mindset, and forget that opportunities are renewable resources. They are abundant and replenishable. They’re all around us in different forms. To change this way of thinking, try to give from a place of abundance, not lack.</p>\n\n<p>By thoughtfully sharing an opportunity or asset with someone in your community, you not only release the scarcity grip, but in some cases, it helps you identify more clearly what you value. You can’t seize every opportunity, so if you see something that is a great fit for someone else, passing it on is a win/win. You get to spend more time on your priorities, and your community benefits from the resource. Opportunity hoarding helps no one. A rising tide lifts all boats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice luxury.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In <em><a href=\"https://thecreativeindependent.com/library/the-artists-way/\">The Artist’s Way</a></em>, Julia Cameron talks about the importance of allowing yourself to experience small, everyday luxuries. A midday nap, a good cheese, a hot bath, a new plant, and silence are all small luxuries. Luxury is not about designer goods or fancy vacations, but about recognizing what’s important to you, and giving yourself permission to experience abundance in your everyday life. If you actively exercise abundance with yourself (because you’re worth it!), it becomes easier to recognize it out in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Make a list of things that would feel luxurious to you. Maybe it’s an hour to spend reading, an afternoon in the park, or a night working on a creative project you haven’t been able to focus on lately. When is the last time you did one of these things? Do it this week. It will make you feel like a million bucks, and help you start experiencing abundance and new possibilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let yourself play.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It can be difficult to allow ourselves time to just experiment and have fun in our creative practices. This is exacerbated by things like social media, which makes us more product-driven, tempting us to produce something that can easily go up on the internet by the end of the day. It’s important for artists to cultivate the space for play — to create something without an end result in mind. Play is the expression of abundance in the studio. Artists need to experience an abundance of new ideas, methods, and materials. Play helps us expand the “suitcase” — our conception of what belongs in our work — and make room for new possibilities to enter into our creative practices.</p>\n\n<p>As you get out of scarcity mindset, try to carve out 30 minutes every week to do something that is not output-driven. Let yourself experiment. Do something that is just for you, no one else. Make this a habit.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"4_How_Can_We_Start_Feeling_Abundant.png\" src=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:2000/zer4mlDWTyS0e4oyA9yI\">\n  \n    <figcaption>\n</figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"in-summary\"><a name=\"summary\">In summary…</a></h2>\n\n<p>Scarcity mindset is the state of believing that what you want is in limited supply. When we’re in scarcity mindset, we engage in either/or thinking, tend to “tunnel” or focus obsessively on the particular thing we feel scarce around, and as a result, lose our bandwidth and perspective.</p>\n\n<p>To get out of the scarcity trap, we need to create an intentional relationship to “the tunnel,” set values-driven priorities to minimize our juggling, and get help from outside resources. We need to examine systems we engage with that reinforce feelings of lack, and change our relationship to these things. We need to cultivate time for play, allow ourselves small luxuries, and support each other. Most of all, we need to focus on the ways we are already resourced, the places where we are already kicking ass, and leverage this gratitude and perspective to help us see opportunities as renewable resources.</p>\n\n\n    </section>\n\n    \n      <section id=\"article__author\">\n        <h2>About the Author</h2>\n        <div id=\"article__author__body\">\n          <figure>\n            \n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/JJDj5k4jRz6nyxvOFObN\" data-credit=\"\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:200/Qu3L4jxQQIuODv9Nch6V\">\n</a>\n            <figcaption>\n              \n              \n                <p>Artist, Coach</p>\n              \n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n  \n          <p><a href=\"http://www.christine-garvey.com/\">Christine Garvey</a> is an artist and coach based in Austin, Texas.

He was desperate to become the listing agent for a new condominium project called 1 Seaport, and had spent weeks fanatically courting its developers at the Fortis Property Group. “I can’t sleep without this building,” Eklund said. “I’m obsessed.” 1 Seaport was to be the first all-glass residential skyscraper ever built on the lower-Manhattan waterfront—sixty stories of upscale urban living, at the edge of the financial district.</p><p>A Fortis executive made Eklund a deal. If he could sell twenty of the eighty planned units before construction began—if he could sell them in just eight weeks—Eklund would get the exclusive on the building. Net sales were projected to reach some three hundred million dollars, and the broker’s cut would be hefty. “My whole life has been leading up to this very moment,” Eklund told the executive. “I’m getting loosey-goosey just talking to you about it.”</p><p>Since the financial crisis, luxury residential skyscrapers have gone up in New York higher and faster than ever before. In Manhattan, many of these structures are clustered in a corridor of midtown called Billionaires’ Row, where hedge-fund managers, foreign plutocrats, and celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez and Sting have reportedly bought units. Though 1 Seaport’s common amenities would include a private porte cochère, a hydrotherapy spa, and, on the thirtieth floor, the practically de-rigueur infinity pool, it was aimed at buyers perhaps a few rungs down the ladder. “Thirty million dollars or more—those are the people we want to get,” Eklund told his sales team, back at the office. He considered travelling to South Africa, Monaco, Hong Kong, and Singapore to woo buyers, and ultimately settled on London. Armed with little more than a few artist’s renderings, he quickly sold the twenty units.</p><div data-testid=\"NewsletterSubscribeFormWrapper\" data-include-experiments=\"true\" data-in-view=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ConnectedNewsletterSubscribeForm&quot;}\" data-event-boundary=\"click\"><h3>Get <i>The New Yorker’s</i> daily newsletter</h3><p>Keep up with everything we offer, plus exclusives available only to newsletter readers, directly in your in-box.</p></div><p>1 Seaport appealed to American buyers, too, including the Miu family, of Holmdel, New Jersey. Louis Miu, who had come to New York in 1970 and put himself through college working at a Chinese restaurant in Bensonhurst, had founded an accounting firm, and was prominent in the city’s Chinese American business community. He, his wife, Carolyn, and their daughter, Erin, who was in her twenties, were drawn to Unit 15-A, a one-bedroom with ten-foot ceilings, three little closets, a terrace overlooking the East River, and an asking price of nearly two million dollars. The Mius signed a purchase agreement with Fortis in March, 2017, and put down a deposit of nearly four hundred thousand dollars. The company said that units in the tower would be ready to close as early as New Year’s Day. “No closings occurred that year,” a lawyer for the Mius would later write.</p><p>Still, the family was willing to wait. In the fall of 2018, Erin got married, and a few months later the Mius altered their contract to acquire two units, which would be combined into one larger apartment. Though the building was more than a year behind schedule, they doubled their deposit.</p><p>It wasn’t until the following summer that the developers admitted that there was a small problem. On June&nbsp;26, 2019, the Fortis Property Group issued an amendment to the building’s offering plan, the contract between the developer and the buyers. The building’s contractors had recently completed the tower’s superstructure. The imposing gray mass was at that point among the hundred tallest structures on the city’s skyline, six feet taller than Trump Tower. “The slab edges on the north side of the building are misaligned by up to 8 inches,” the developer disclosed. 1 Seaport was six hundred and seventy feet tall, and leaning.</p><p>For as long as humans have made towers, some have leaned. The Tower of Pisa started settling unevenly on its shallow foundation not long after its third floor was added, in 1178. Despite the increasingly obvious problem, five more floors were built over the next two centuries; the ornate bell chamber was finished in 1372. In 1990, when the angle passed five degrees, and the top of the tower was fifteen feet out of plumb, the structure was said to be finally in danger of collapsing. Crews siphoned earth from underneath the building to mitigate the problem, though by then it was unthinkable to eliminate the lean entirely. Millions of tourists came to see the flawed structure every year. A complete fix would have devastated the local economy.</p><p>The allure of a tilted building knows no cultural boundary. In the fourteenth century, when the medieval traveller Ibn Battuta visited the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, in Mosul, he wrote that its curving minaret was “splendid,” and affectionately referred to it as al-Habda, or “the hunchback.” The mosque was destroyed in 2017, during the Battle of Mosul. <em>UNESCO</em> later surveyed locals about restoring it, and ninety-four per cent of respondents said that they wanted the minaret rebuilt “exactly as it was.” The Leaning Temple of Huma, in India, has drawn pilgrims for centuries. The complex’s tall central tower tilts visibly one way. Arrayed around it are several smaller towers that tilt visibly the other way. No one knows why this is.</p><p>In recent years, architects around the world have embraced the slant. The Altair twin skyscrapers, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, are seven hundred and eighty-seven feet tall, with one standing at attention and the other leaning companionably against it. The Capital Gate, in Abu Dhabi, inclines eighteen degrees to the west, and looks like a “Dune” sandworm mid-leap. But these bold diagonals lack the fundamental humanity of those which are accidentally off-kilter. The headquarters of China’s state television service, in Beijing, consists of two angled towers conjoined at the top, and was meant to subvert clichés of skyscraper design. Locals refer to it as Big Pants.</p><p>The Fortis Property Group, destined to put up one of the tallest leaning towers in the history of mankind, was founded in 2005 by Louis and Joel Kestenbaum and some partners. The Kestenbaums, a father and son who are members of the Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, made their reputations in city real-estate circles during the redevelopment of the Brooklyn waterfront, which went from a sagging industrial district to an international life-style capital. They were known as risktakers, willing to outbid bigger companies on projects that they believed in. In 2013, Fortis paid sixty-four million dollars for one of the last undeveloped parcels in lower Manhattan, a small parking lot at the end of Maiden Lane. This was where 1 Seaport would stand.</p><p>An ideal site for a skyscraper is above strong, flat bedrock that is relatively close to the surface, about fifty feet underground. The bedrock below much of midtown is at that depth. 161 Maiden Lane is not such a site. The Dutch, who laid out Maiden Lane in the seventeenth century, were the first to use “infill”—sand, stones, trash, whatever was handy—to expand the contours of Manhattan. Later, local officials sold “water lots,” or parcels of land submerged below the East River or the Hudson River, on which developers could dump infill themselves. When geotechnical consultants hired by Fortis took soundings of the earth underneath the parking lot, they found a mishmash. First, twenty-four feet of Colonial-era infill, composed of gravel, silt, concrete, steel, bricks, and chunks of old shipwrecks and docks. Below that, pancaked former marshland. Below that, sandy deposits left by glaciers thousands of years ago, and a layer of decomposed rock. The bedrock under 161 Maiden Lane was way down there, about a hundred and fifty-five feet below ground level.</p><p>It’s not impossible to build a skyscraper on a lot like this, but it usually involves more work. “Begin by descending,” St. Augustine wrote, more than a millennium ago. “You plan a tower that will pierce the clouds? Lay first the foundation of humility.” Structural engineers in New York City are still giving this kind of advice to their clients. “I always tell them, pay the foundation person more money than you’d ever imagine paying them, because you will never fix a foundation,” Nat Oppenheimer, a senior vice-president at the engineering firm TYLin, told me.</p><p>Since the end of the nineteenth century, skyscrapers in the financial district have been built using “pile” foundations, formed by drilling steel pylons through the ground until they reach bedrock. The Fortis Property Group, for reasons that remain the subject of multiple overlapping and complex civil litigations, opted for a different kind of foundation, less often used in Manhattan high-rise construction, called “soil improvement,” which involves injecting concrete into the ground to firm it up. The process promised to save the company six million dollars, but it came with some risks. An engineering consultant named Robert Alperstein produced a nearly hundred-page report that warned Fortis that the method could lead to “differential settlements.” In other words, the structure might lean. All other nearby buildings, the report said, were anchored to the earth by piles.</p><p>Construction was under way when, in the fall of 2016, the Kestenbaums invited real-estate big shots, brokers, and reporters to a party to toast 1 Seaport. A Hinckley yacht ferried the guests to dinner at the River Café, in Brooklyn, where they were served individual mousse cakes topped with chocolate in the shape of the Brooklyn Bridge. Soon, potential buyers were being taken on “hard hat” tours of the building as it crept up into the sky. One prospective buyer, who asked not to be named, recalled riding a rickety lift to one of the middle floors of the tower, to look at a slab of fresh concrete where blueprints called for a two-bedroom unit. “There was construction debris, and safety fencing at the edges,” the buyer said. The wind was whipping in off the East River. “Still,” she added, “I could tell it wouldn’t work from a closet-space perspective.”</p><p>To build 1 Seaport, Fortis hired Pizzarotti, a renowned Italian construction firm that was trying to break into the New York City high-rise market, as the construction manager. Pizzarotti in turn hired a local company called SSC High Rise to build the tower’s concrete superstructure. The job site was troubled from the start. “Workers were operating equipment in darkness, without light, and there was debris in the work area,” an attorney on one of the many lawsuits involving the project told me. The Department of Buildings slapped more than a dozen stop-work orders on the property, several for safety violations. It was the kind of nonunion job site that inspired Local 157, the Manhattan carpenters’ union, to bring out one of its large inflatable rats. James Makin, a former organizer with the union, who spent many days leafletting outside 1 Seaport, told me recently that SSC High Rise was notorious. “Another contractor cutting corners to get things done,” he said.</p><p>Among the workers on the project was a forty-four-year-old carpenter from Ecuador named Juan Chonillo. He had moved to Queens in 2006 with his older sister, Angela, and joined some cousins working in high-rise construction. Angela marvelled at how quickly her brother had picked up English on the job sites. He was sending money home to his five kids. He was happy in New York.</p><p>On the morning of September 21, 2017, Chonillo and several of his cousins were standing on a movable construction platform attached to 1 Seaport’s recently poured twenty-ninth floor. Around 9:15 <em>a.m.</em>, a foreman working for SSC High Rise ordered that a crane operator move the platform. It got snagged, and Chonillo made for the edge, to try to wrench it free. The platform wobbled. Chonillo fell through the air for about five seconds, and landed on the sidewalk scaffolding running along Maiden Lane. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The crane operator “came outside from the building and he was crying,” an employee at the job site later said in a sworn statement. “He told me that he asked at least five times if all the workers were off the platform and he was told that there were no workers on the platform.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=\"\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24582\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24582&quot;}\"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“More gravy?”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Matthew Diffee</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Construction in Manhattan is a small world. Makin, the union organizer, received numerous texts and images from Chonillo’s colleagues almost immediately after he hit the scaffolding. Makin rushed downtown. The site was ringed with yellow police tape. Angela Chonillo was there, wailing. The lawyers Gail and Robert Kelner, who later represented Angela in a wrongful-death suit filed against 1 Seaport’s builders, said that Chonillo’s fall was one of the most egregious construction-site cases they’d seen in decades of workplace-injury lawsuits. “There never should have been workers on the platform,” Gail Kelner said. “It was extremely shoddy, sloppy, frightening workmanship.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\" data-journey-hook=\"client-content\"><p>Eventually, SSC High Rise pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter. The fine was ten thousand dollars, which even the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, acknowledged was “pennies on the dollar compared to the potential profits on a high-rise construction job in a booming real-estate market.” But his investigators had been stymied. SSC High Rise employees, including Chonillo’s cousins, had refused to talk to them. “No one wanted to jeopardize their jobs by speaking up,” an investigator for the D.A.’s office who worked on the case told me. The D.A. never even got the name of the foreman who gave the order to move the platform.</p><p>Angela Chonillo put three thousand dollars on her credit card to pay for her brother’s funeral. She said that she never again spoke to the cousins who were with Juan the day he fell. Two of them, including the one who had got Chonillo the job at 1 Seaport, later died from <em>COVID</em>-19. “He didn’t want to testify, out of fear, maybe,” she told me recently, sitting in the Kelners’ office, in the financial district, just a few blocks from where Juan died.</p><p>After Chonillo’s death, the city paused construction on 1 Seaport for about three months. When work resumed, SSC High Rise disappeared. One morning in March, 2018, the company’s employees simply didn’t show up for work. They were never seen on the job site again, and the firm later went out of business. (“I don’t recall,” Timothy Mahoney, the C.E.O. of SSC High Rise, would later say in a deposition, when asked to supply a date for his company’s closure.)</p><p>The project fell further behind, and soon the relationship between Pizzarotti and Fortis soured, too. “Maiden lane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the gift that keeps giving,” one of the project’s lenders wrote to a colleague. The Italian contractors seem to have been perplexed by the cutthroat nature of New York City construction. The New Yorkers, meanwhile, were at times baffled by the Italians’ genteel airs. “Often I personally ask myself what I should do more to be more effective in my action and I do not always find the answer,” Stefano Soncini, a Pizzarotti executive, wrote to a Fortis executive in a rambling e-mail. “I hope you can find in my words the serenity necessary to make you soon return to work with us with the enthusiasm necessary to win this challenge.” By the end of the note, Soncini was embarrassed at his verbosity. “I wrote a poem and I apologize for the time that I made you lose,” he signed off. There was a lot of that going around 1 Seaport.</p><p>In an attempt to resolve the growing tensions between their two firms, Louis Kestenbaum and Paolo Pizzarotti traded e-mails, corporate patriarch to corporate patriarch. “Dear Paolo,” Kestenbaum wrote. “As we mentioned to you previously, completion by the end of the year is too late. It would be devastating to us. It would result in many purchaser contract cancellations, leading to a complete financial disaster.”</p><p>Pizzarotti, the grandson of his firm’s founder and a <em>cavaliere del lavoro</em>, or knight of Italy’s Order of Merit for Labor, was magnanimous. “Dear Luis,” he wrote, misspelling his client’s name. “I hope you’re well.” He suggested several ways that the project might move faster—including having the job site open seven days a week. Kestenbaum was apoplectic. “I have <em>never</em> worked with anyone on a Saturday and will <em>never</em> work on a Saturday,” he wrote. “It is a matter of religious principles which are not negotiable.”</p><p>After SSC High Rise ghosted the project, Pizzarotti brought in a replacement concrete contractor to finish the superstructure. The new firm did a review of the tower and noticed something amiss. On April 17, 2018, Pizzarotti received a fateful memo: “There are structural issues, unusual settlement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The building is leaning 3 inches to the north.”</p><p>But, as with Pisa, work on the tower did not stop. It only got more frenzied. “There is a lot of organizational disorder and many uncertainties in decision-making,” Soncini, the Pizzarotti poet, wrote to his muse at the Fortis Property Group. “The situation of One Seaport project is of great frustration for everyone, including myself.” Rather than pausing to fix what had already been done, an attempt was made to straighten the thing out in midair. To compensate for the lean, higher floors were intentionally poured out of alignment, in the opposite direction. This compounded the problem. “What happened was, as the building went up, the parties tried to pull it back and it kind of counterweighted,” a lawyer representing Pizzarotti later explained to a judge. “Your Honor,” the lawyer said, “it’s shaped like a banana right now.”</p><p>Measurements taken in the winter of 2019 indicated that the building was as much as ten inches out of alignment on some floors. Pizzarotti had had enough. On March 22nd, the company filed a lawsuit, seeking to break its contract. In a complaint, Pizzarotti’s lawyers claimed that Fortis had withheld crucial information about 1 Seaport’s foundation. They also said that the building was “still moving,” and that they didn’t know how much further it might lean if it was simply left standing. Many participants and observers in the 1 Seaport saga suggested to me that a local contractor may have had more incentive to deal with the tower’s problems. Pizzarotti, a foreign firm, had leeway to bail. “They had to get the fuck out,” someone involved in 1 Seaport’s development told me.</p><p>Fortis countersued, and the company blamed Pizzarotti for the issues that arose during the tower’s construction, including Chonillo’s death, which happened the second day of Rosh Hashanah. “The accident took place on a Jewish holiday, a day during which Pizzarotti was contractually prohibited from working,” a Fortis executive said in an affidavit. “This terrible incident&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. could have been avoided had Pizzarotti followed the rules.” The ensuing web of 1 Seaport lawsuits—there are now more than two dozen—continue to wind through Manhattan’s civil courts. Even the lawyers can’t seem to believe how many lawyers are involved. One exasperated judge castigated all parties for waging “an endless war of attrition.”</p><p>Work on 1 Seaport stopped in July, 2020, and it has not resumed. In 2021, the building was put into the custody of Richard Cohn, a kind of real-estate foster parent who tends to neglected and litigation-scarred properties throughout the city. The tower has continued to sulk over the waterfront, more a ruin than a construction site, its grim façade visible from the Brooklyn Bridge, the Wall Street heliport, and even from the N.Y.P.D.’s headquarters, nearly a mile away. The barren structure, half wrapped in glass, is particularly noticeable at night, when strings of bright construction lights illuminate every floor. Despite Cohn’s efforts to secure the building, it was vandalized in late 2023. Three graffiti artists used ropes to scale up the side of 1 Seaport, and tagged the northern face with a stack of giant bubble letters—“XSM RAMS NOTE”—spanning the top three stories. “There was no guard,” one of the artists told me. “We could have gone through the front door.”</p><p>The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, in his 1978 manifesto, “Delirious New York,” wrote that a skyscraper “cannot avoid being a symbol—an empty one, available for meaning as a billboard is for advertisement.” People look at a thwarted building and see what they want to see. In the fifteen-fifties, when Pieter Bruegel the Elder set out to depict the Tower of Babel, he painted a structure that was visibly crooked, though no lean is mentioned in Scripture. In recent years, several of the slender towers on Billionaires’ Row have been afflicted with excessive swaying and creaking, problems that are gleefully treated in the press as morality plays about rising inequality. (“High Anxiety: Super-rich Find Supertall Skyscraper an Uncomfortable Perch,” read one headline in the <em>Guardian</em>.) A decade ago, the Millennium Tower, a new residential skyscraper in San Francisco, was found to be several inches out of plumb and tilting further every month. Managers at Fortis and Pizzarotti, unaware of what was in store for them, exchanged gaga e-mails about the situation. “What a mess that is, I wouldn’t feel safe in that building at all!” one Pizzarotti employee wrote.</p><p>Structural engineers have determined repeatedly over the years that the structure at 161 Maiden Lane is unlikely to topple over. But the project known as 1 Seaport collapsed long ago. No broker in the world can sell a leaning tower at twenty-four hundred dollars per square foot, even if the lean is imperceptible to the naked eye, and even though the flaw is not so anomalous. Ronald Hamburger, the structural engineer who devised the nine-figure repair job for the Millennium Tower, told me that he and his colleagues canvassed the Bay Area and discovered that tilted buildings were quite common. “But because they weren’t high-end residential condominiums, no one cared,” he said.</p><p>Representatives for the Fortis Property Group, Pizzarotti, SSC High Rise, and more than a dozen other firms and individuals involved in 1 Seaport declined to comment for this story. Several of the Fortis Property Group’s lawyers have quit working for the company, and one firm has sued for unpaid bills. Buyers, including the Mius, have sued to recover their deposits. (The Mius, too, declined to comment.) At least a quarter of a billion dollars has been collectively spent on 1 Seaport, and yet everyone claims to be out of pocket.</p><p>The Fortis Property Group still hopes to finish 1 Seaport, someday. Perhaps there would be people willing to live in it. Prices are still high on Billionaires’ Row, despite the swaying. (Engineers have found ingenious ways to install bespoke dampers, some involving giant sloshing tanks of water, to minimize residents’ feelings of nausea.) And stalled towers are rarely abandoned for good. Construction on the Jeddah Tower, in Saudi Arabia, which is slated to be the world’s first kilometre-high skyscraper, has resumed after a six-year pause that followed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s arrest of the project’s primary backer, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. The Ryugyong Hotel, a thousand-foot concrete pyramid intended to awe the world, loomed partially built over Pyongyang, North Korea, for more than a decade after the fall of the Soviet Union. Today, an enormous L.E.D. screen has been fitted on one side, and at night it displays propaganda.</p><p>Hoping to get a closer look at 1 Seaport, I sent e-mails to some of the companies with offices in 180 Maiden Lane, a forty-one-story skyscraper right across the street. An executive with a direct view of the busted tower invited me to take a peek. “I was excited when I got this office, because I like having construction outside my window—something to look at while I daydream,” he told me. “But then I started to notice that nothing was happening.”</p><p>When the sun sets, the tower takes on a menacing quality, with its concrete terraces jutting out like spikes on a club. Later at night, when the construction lights are on, it’s possible to imagine that the building is inhabited—that people are up there drinking wine, slipping into the infinity pool, looking down on the city at their feet. Before it started leaning, 1 Seaport was designed to withstand hundreds of years of wind off the harbor. Until someone figures out what to do with it, it’ll hang there, the tallest eyesore on the skyline.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>",

It was her day off, and she was going there to see an exhibition called Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art. She had just arrived in London on a coach from Oxford and was run over by a bus outside Victoria Station. This was on a Friday morning in early May. The next day, in my apartment in Manhattan, I received an unexpected call—my mother never calls me—from a trauma ward in West London. “I’m in a lot of pain,” she said in a loud, anguished, slurring voice I hardly recognized, “but I’m in very good hands.” A few hours later, I was on a flight&nbsp;home.</p>\n<p>When I visited her in the hospital, Mom asked me whether the show was worth losing her legs for. “No,” I told her, though at that point, I hadn’t seen it. When I did, two weeks later, my answer proved correct. Unravel featured tapestries, quilts, needlework, sculptures, and installations by modern artists, the majority of whom were of historically marginalized identities. The curators proposed that textiles themselves had also been marginalized, having been gendered as feminine and regarded as “craft” rather than “fine art.” As a result, the exhibition’s introductory text argued, the more politically radical aspects of textile making had been obscured. “What does it mean to imagine a needle, a loom or a garment as a tool of resistance?” the text&nbsp;asked.</p>\n<p>Hanging from the ceiling above the entrance were Native American–style garments by Jeffrey Gibson, a painter and sculptor who also represented the United States in the country’s pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale. Inspired by his Choctaw and Cherokee heritage, the pieces were adorned with rainbow-patterned patchworks printed with the phrases <span>people like us</span><span>, </span><span>we play endlessly</span><span>, </span>and <span>speak to me so that i can understand</span>. Farther in, among other things, were a painted collage depicting a cheerful black woman in a bodega; small realist embroideries of drag and dyke marches in New York City; sculptures of cacti stitched from U.S.&nbsp;Border Patrol uniforms; and an image of a woman giving birth embroidered on blood-red silk, her vast womb radiating waves of energy. There were decorative knotted pieces, hand-stitched collages, abstract woven works suspended in air, and pillowy bundles of&nbsp;cloth.</p>\n<p>The gallery was broken up by a series of empty spaces. Shortly after it opened, Unravel began to come slowly undone as a number of pieces were withdrawn in protest of the Barbican’s decision not to host a <em>London Review of Books </em>lecture series that was scheduled to include “The Shoah After Gaza,” a talk by the writer Pankaj Mishra that he later published as an essay in the magazine. The disappearances began when two pieces by Loretta Pettway, an elderly quilter from Gee’s Bend, Alabama, were removed by their lenders, Lorenzo Legarda Leviste and Fahad Mayet. Another lender and four prominent artists followed suit. Some of them wrote open letters alleging that the museum was censoring pro-Palestinian speech. In the words of the Lebanese painter, embroiderer, and video artist Mounira Al Solh, “speakers who are raising their voices for justice are being canceled.”</p>\n<p>The Chilean poet and installation artist Cecilia Vicuña allowed her hanging woolen streamers to remain in the exhibition, but pinned a letter next to them declaring solidarity with her dissenting colleagues. Yee I-Lann—whose display of traditional Malaysian patterned mats with silhouettes of tables woven into them was meant to subvert the “power of the table,” apparently a symbol of Portuguese, British, and Dutch oppression—also declined to pull her artwork. Instead, she had a table (!) brought in from the Barbican’s administrative offices, on which was displayed a copy of the issue of the <em>LRB</em> in which Mishra’s essay was published. Pasted on the cover were two canary-yellow stickers displaying QR codes leading to an animated website with flashing boldface text by Leviste and Mayet that&nbsp;read:</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;censorship at the barbican</span><br>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repression at the barbican</span><br>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;racism at the barbican</span><br>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genocide at the barbican</span></p>\n<p>It was the most depressing exhibition I had ever seen at the gallery, hardly worth a visit, let alone losing one’s legs. While Unravel pretended to be politically radical—even revolutionary—it didn’t seem to stand for much beyond liberal orthodoxy and feel-good ambient diversity. It offered fantasies of resistance, but had little to offer in terms of genuine, substantive social change or artistic experimentation. The works were almost entirely produced with traditional methods and materials, in recognizable aesthetics, and might as well have dated from half a century ago, if not much&nbsp;earlier.</p>\n<p>Such retrospection was not limited to the Barbican. Just before my mother’s accident, I had gone to the sixtieth edition of the Venice Biennale, the longest-running regularly recurring survey of international art in the world. What I found there had been much the same: a nostalgic turn to history and a fascination with identity, rendered in familiar forms. This year’s Biennale, called Foreigners Everywhere, took four identities as its subjects—the queer artist; the outsider artist; the folk artist; the indigenous artist—and suggested that they were all foreigners because they were marginalized. It was a show of painted, handsewn, sculpted, photographed, and filmed portraits of such figures; naïve scenes of everyday life across the Global South, from Aboriginal Australia to the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon; and traditional pottery, wood carving, metal sculpture, and dyed fabric. There was a massive mural by a women’s collective from Bangalore; a contemporary dance interpretation of violence committed against Chinese migrants and queer people in the West by a millennial choreographer from Hong Kong; a text painting that read <span>anonymous homosexual</span>; and, on an outdoor patio, a bronze nude self-portrait of a transgender artist on a plinth that said, simply, <span>woman</span>.</p>\n<p>In fact, every major biennial I have visited over the past eight years—from Germany to Greece, Italy to the United States, Brazil to the United Arab Emirates—has taken as its themes the deep richness of identity and the rejection of the West. These biennials have embraced overlooked artists from the twentieth century and exhibited recycled junk, traditional craft, and folk art. Their press releases have heralded the reclamation of precolonial forms of knowledge like indigenous thought and&nbsp;magic.</p>\n<p>Only ten years ago, the art world was something very different: a globalized circuit of biennials and fairs that ran on the international trade of ideas and commodities. It was a space of spectacle and innovation, where artists tried out wildly different mediums and entertained radical ideas about what art could do and why. They were workshopping new cultural forms for a new millennium. Art was where experimentation happened, where people worked out what it felt like to be alive in this strange new century and how to give that feeling a form. Artists were researchers who were never expected to come to any conclusions. They had the freedom of absolute purposelessness.</p>\n<p><img sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" srcset=\"https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-795x1124.jpg 795w, https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-212x300.jpg 212w, https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-1086x1536.jpg 1086w, https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-1448x2048.jpg 1448w, https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-scaled.jpg 1810w\" height=\"700\" width=\"495\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CUT-7-795x1124.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>But as faith in the liberal order began to fall apart around 2016, this conception of art no longer seemed relevant. As concerns over identity, social issues, and inequalities intensified, there was a sense that the art world had grown frivolous and decadent, that the proliferation of forms and approaches over the decades had reached its limit. Art, which had previously been a way to produce discursive polyphony, aligned itself with the dominant social-justice discourses of the day, with works dressed up as protest and contextualized according to decolonial or queer theory, driven by a singular focus on identity.</p>\n<p>This turn was a consequence of the art world’s own exhaustion and overexpansion; here was a new direction for art, a belief system to follow that might restore some of its meaning and relevance, perhaps even a grand narrative and a purpose. The ambition to explore every facet of the present was quickly replaced by a devout commitment to questions of equity and accountability. There was a new answer to the question of what art should do: it should amplify the voices of the historically marginalized. What it shouldn’t do, it seemed, is be inventive or interesting.</p>\n<p><span>T</span>he philosopher and critic Arthur Danto believed that art ended in the Sixties. From the late nineteenth century onward, there had been a churning succession of modernist movements, each reacting against the last and proposing its own answers to fundamental questions about what art should be. By the end of the Sixties, however—following the convulsive leaps forward of Pop Art, with its erasure of the distinction between artworks and everyday objects, and conceptualism, with its dissolution of objects into ideas—there was nowhere left for modern art to go, Danto&nbsp;wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At first only mimesis was art, then several things were art but each tried to extinguish its competitors, and then, finally, it became apparent that there were no stylistic or philosophical constraints. There is no special way works of art have to be. . . . It is the end of the&nbsp;story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like a Buddha that meditated too deeply and passed over enlightenment on the way to raving insanity, modern art had destroyed itself through excessive, nihilistic contemplation. There would still be art, Danto said, and it might even thrive, but the grand narrative of modernism was&nbsp;over.</p>\n<p>To Danto, the closing of this narrative of progress was what made the “contemporary” possible. As art would no longer respond to itself, and no longer had any constraints, other human activities could be drawn from the world into its hungry maw. Art was no longer moving forward. Individual artists were free to consume the present, swallow other cultural forms, and twist them into new experiences.</p>\n<p>Variety abounded: Cao Fei built a floating city in the virtual-reality world <em>Second Life</em>; Paola Pivi filled a Swiss <em>Kunsthalle</em> with three thousand cups of cappuccino and a leopard; Cai Guo-Qiang choreographed a fireworks display of a giant’s footprints running across the Beijing sky for the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics; Wael Shawky filmed an adaptation of Amin Maalouf’s historical essay <em>The Crusades Through Arab Eyes </em>as a feature-length puppet cabaret epic; Philippe Parreno journeyed to Patagonia to tell two hours of rambling philosophical stories to a colony of penguins on the beach, taking only a single photograph as documentation; Carsten Höller kept a herd of reindeer in Berlin’s Hamburger Bahnhof, fed half of them fly agaric mushrooms, and built a toadstool-shaped hotel room in which overnight guests could help themselves to the deer’s potentially hallucinogenic&nbsp;urine.</p>\n<p>The art of the 1990s, 2000s, and early 2010s was pluralist in its intentions, forms, and subjects. Contemporary art took in such miscellaneous concerns as literature and poetry, avant-garde dance, theater, cinema, broadcast television, psychoanalysis, philosophy, history, politics, noise music, pornography, pole dancing, online abjection, ritual sacrifice, crucifixion, cannibalism, Thai cookouts, Zinedine Zidane playing a soccer match in Madrid, long-distance sailing, astronomy, industrial design, being a dog, biting people—everything. It could all be remade as art. The “contemporary” was eternally elusive, moving ever further away with artists in pursuit, an endless research&nbsp;project.</p>\n<p>In those days, it was possible to feel part of a vanguard and—because there was a mania in the art world and a level of self-belief that moneyed people felt obliged to encourage—receive the support and resources to attempt the grandest projects. Contemporary art was fundamentally optimistic; there was a conviction that making art was a good in itself, that pushing its boundaries was a worthwhile endeavor, and that great leaps forward in culture were still possible. Theorists, philosophers, poets, and writers were lured in from other fields. The art world was where you would find the broadest remit to do whatever you wanted. It was where you could find the most unusual and preposterous ideas—and open bars, sex, and glamour too. This was the art world that I was drawn&nbsp;to.</p>\n<p>Throughout my twenties, when I was studying art history and curation, interning at public and commercial galleries, and working at style magazines in London, art felt very important. It was moving fast—there was a constant flow of new artists and thinkers, and an obligation to keep up with them. Hans Ulrich Obrist, the preeminent Aughts super-curator, for whom I interned at London’s Serpentine Galleries in the summer of 2008, would always say that everything was “urgent”; it was urgent that the art crowd kept talking about art, urgent that they kept making it, and urgent that they kept seeing it. There were so many fascinating people to meet, so many ideas to explore, so many projects that needed to be realized—but so little time. Obrist used to host a series of salons, known as the Brutally Early Club, at cafés around London where writers and thinkers would gather to discuss their ideas at six-thirty in the morning. There was no time to&nbsp;rest.</p>\n<p>Obrist was known to his friends and colleagues as “Hurricane.” He circumnavigated the world relentlessly, meeting everyone he could and introducing them to one another, in person or over email on his two BlackBerries, insisting on the urgency of their conversation. If the role of the contemporary artist was to consume the world, Obrist believed the role of the curator was to connect it, to become the conduit through which all twenty-first-century creativity and thought might flow. In attempting this, he may well have lost parts of his mind, as one understandably will, getting too little sleep, passing through too many time zones too quickly, sending and receiving too many messages, hearing too many foolish ideas from too many crazy people. (At one point, he had small therapy magnets taped to his temples.) He almost destroyed himself, as a committed early-twenty-first-century citizen should, in an orgy of connectivity.</p>\n<p>Obrist’s frenzied devotion reflected his conviction that everything should be linked, his idealistic belief in the humanist possibilities of the internet and of globalization. He still dreamed that connectivity could bring everyone together, across borders and disciplines—that you could make friends with like-minded people around the world, bound by common interests. Art would be the gateway to every other form of culture and philosophy: a map of the present, a new universal language.</p>\n<p>In 2013, at Marco Polo Airport, waiting for the flight home to London from that year’s Biennale, my friends and I sat around on the floor discussing what the best life might be. The life of an artist, we all agreed. Pursuing art was the way to be happy and free. Artists could do whatever they pleased; they were famous, respected, and sexually desirable; they could turn anything into art and create their own reasons for doing so; they made huge amounts of money for not doing very much. Surely there was nothing better. But nobody from that airport floor really made it as an artist. Some found success in more conventional careers, some grew staggeringly wealthy off early investments in Ethereum, some dropped out of society, and many I’ve forgotten were ever there in the first place. Slowly at first, and then all at once, the music faded, the guests vanished, and the party was over. Contemporary art had become so popular, so urgent, so cool, and so well-funded that a fall, in retrospect, was inevitable. As soon as it reached its peak, the height of its great flourishing, it had already begun its precipitous&nbsp;decline.</p>\n<p><span>E</span>arly signs of a change could be seen in 2017. That year, Documenta—one of the world’s largest art exhibitions, which normally takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany—was subtitled “Learning from Athens” and opened in the Greek capital, chosen for its symbolic importance as a gateway from Europe to the Global South. Particular attention was paid to indigenous artists, such as the Kwakwaka’wakw sculptor Beau Dick, whose masks filled the first room, and various obscure historical artists, including an unexpected number of twentieth-century Albanian socialist realist painters. There was much to gain in the present, the artistic director, Adam Szymczyk, explained at the press conference, by turning to the past, by “unlearning” everything we thought we&nbsp;knew.</p>\n<p>This was at the time a surprising approach—the shock of the old—because it abandoned contemporary art’s obsession with the present as well as the hierarchy that separated high art from folk traditions, throwing everything together into one sprawling show. The results were overwhelming. It was the first time I’d seen traditional, beautiful works like the Indian painter Nilima Sheikh’s suite of magic realist tempera-on-scroll landscapes populated with folkloric beings (titled Each Night Put Kashmir in Your Dreams) given such prominence in a major show; the first time I’d seen the handwoven representation of a microprocessor that the Intel Corporation commissioned the Navajo textile artist Marilou Schultz to make in the Nineties; the first time I’d heard the Russian composer Arseny Avraamov’s <em>Symphony of Sirens,</em> which was first performed on factory sirens, bells, navy foghorns, and artillery in Baku in 1922 to mark the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution.</p>\n<p>The cumulative effect of these unexpected encounters with so many unfamiliar aesthetics and ideas was disorienting and thrilling. Szymczyk attempted to contain the whole world, its peoples, and modern history in forty-seven venues in Athens and thirty-five more in Kassel. Nobody since has dared to create an exhibition so ambitious or done anywhere near as good a job with this historical, nonhierarchical approach.</p>\n<p>I went to Venice that same year. The Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto had collaborated with the Amazonian Huni Kuin people on a large crocheted ceremonial tent called <em>Um Sagrado Lugar</em> (“A Sacred Place”), which functioned as the centerpiece of the exhibition’s Pavilion of Shamans. During those balmy opening days, the Huni Kuin led dancing processions through the crowds of curators, critics, dealers, and socialites milling about the Giardini parkland as though they were actors in a Fellini film. Seven years later, at the 2024 Biennale, representatives of this indigenous people with a population of around eleven thousand still had the spotlight: the entire façade of the central pavilion in the Giardini was covered in a mural painted by the Movimento dos Artistas Huni Kuin (MAHKU). Inspired by <em>nixi pae</em> (“enchanted thread”) rituals in which they imbibe psychoactive ayahuasca brew, recite songs led by their chant master, and experience hallucinatory <em>ramibiranai</em> (“emerging images”), the Huni Kuin artists channeled the perspective of Yube, the boa constrictor spirit of the forest, using painting as a way of recording their tradition. At the exhibition’s entrance, the story of the alligator bridge between Asia and the Americas—in which a giant alligator agreed to bring humans over the Bering Strait, only to submerge itself when they betrayed him—was painted across the colonnade in a coloring-book style of emotionless cartoon forms filled in with lurid, unblended pigments, which seemed less suited to the entrance of a major exhibition of contemporary art than to a kindergarten playground. It suggested a kind of missionary zeal in reverse: rather than crisscrossing the globe and stealing the natives’ souls with cameras, curators now bring painted images of more primitive ways of life back to the disenchanted West so that viewers might be healed by their embodied knowledge, or otherwise access a direct link to the time before the Fall, to a paradise unspoiled by Trump, populism, Silicon Valley, globalization, modernity, the Enlightenment, capitalism, colonialism, nationalism, whiteness, linear time, and the Agricultural Revolution. Our god might be dead, but there is a wish to rediscover other, older&nbsp;gods.</p>\n<p>One might reasonably identify a return to tradition, a longing for the past, with the forces of political reaction. But if conservatives generally have little interest in novelty, neither does anyone else today. Everyone in the world of contemporary art wants to revive a tradition, however recent: Hellenistic Greek sculpture, the Roman cult of Adonis, ancient Nubian wedding ceremonies, Ancestral Pueblo pottery culture, pre-Columbian Mesoamerican song, Mapuche cosmology, Maya Tz’utujil weaving, Incan mythology, African mask-making and the early Cubist painting it inspired, Fifties Americana, the Sixties New Sacred Art Movement of the Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, Eighties Beijing migrant-worker cruising culture, late-Aughts contemporary art, etc. Everyone, it seems, wants to escape the present. We just long for different&nbsp;pasts.</p>\n<p>Exactly which past artists long for largely accords with their own cultural heritage, the performance of which—engaging in the aesthetic traditions of their ancestors, producing literal representations of their communities and themselves, or simply making their identity and personal history their subject matter—is duly rewarded. One particularly popular genre consists of artists filming themselves wandering the rainforest or reenacting old rituals, making videos that exist somewhere between ethnographic documentary and TikTok dance. At this year’s Whitney Biennial, Even Better Than the Real Thing, in New York City, the Chilean Mapuche artist Sebastiana Calfuqueo filmed themself dragging a long trail of shiny blue fabric through the sacred Pehuén forest to a pool below a waterfall. For Unravel, Antonio Pichillá Quiacaín filmed himself in the Guatemalan wilderness wrapping a backstrap loom around a tree and twisting together a bright umbilical cord, in reference to the ancestral Tz’utujil cultural practice, passed down to him by his mother, of weaving as a way of preserving knowledge. For Foreigners Everywhere, the Sudanese-Norwegian artist Ahmed Umar filmed his performance of a traditional Sudanese bridal dance topless for the camera, having upped “his intake of Norwegian chocolates to enlarge his physical silhouette.”</p>\n<p>At the Whitney Biennial in particular, many varieties of remixed neoindigeneity were on display. Eamon Ore-Giron’s paintings reimagined figures from ancient Andean folklore, such as the dragon Amaru and the great creator Viracocha’s double-headed rainbow, in the pastel shades and flat Corporate Memphis style of millennial-startup subway advertisements. Across the room, past Dala Nasser’s timber and clay-dyed fabric installation modeled after the Temple of Adonis, Clarissa Tossin’s video of performances by the Maya K’iche-’Kaqchiquel poet Rosa Chávez and the Ixil artist Tohil Fidel Brito Bernal featured music played on 3D-printed replicas of Mayan wind instruments. Rounding out the grouping was Rose B.&nbsp;Simpson’s circle of life-size female figures made in the Pueblo ceramics tradition practiced by her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. The statues were adorned with twine, lava bead, <em>oshá</em> root, and hide, and covered in mysterious painted symbols: pluses, diagonal crosses, columns of dashes, and spirals. Simpson describes her idols&nbsp;as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>tools to use to heal the damages I have experienced as a human being of our postmodern and postcolonial era—objectification, stereotyping, and the disempowering detachment of our creative selves through the ease of modern technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They are talismans that protect against the&nbsp;present.</p>\n<p>The painter Louis Fratino was one of the youngest artists to be given substantial space at Venice. He also happened to be one of the few who is a bona fide star of the commercial art market. Like many of his contemporaries, Fratino, who is thirty-one, works in a notably conservative style despite his progressive subject matter: homoerotic scenes in the style of a mid-career Picasso. He works in modernist pastiche—or, as the catalogue puts it, “a visual vocabulary he synthesizes from art history’s greatest hits.” He’s a twenty-first-century gay American Cubist. Fratino rose quickly from obscurity at the end of the 2010s to become a market darling of the recent boom in figurative painting. His highest-priced work, <em>An Argument</em>—a dreamy domestic scene of two naked men sleeping, one on a living-room sofa and the other outside on the balcony, which sold at Sotheby’s New York for $730,800 in 2022—hung at the Biennale alongside other hits like <em>Metropolitan</em> and <em>I Keep My Treasure in My Ass.</em> While modernism was a conscious break with the past, Fratino’s paintings are something like a conscious break with the future; they are representative of today’s culture of spin-offs, remakes, quotations, interpolations, and revivals. In this respect, the art world is not so different from movie studios, fashion houses, or record labels—new culture is made from nothing but old&nbsp;culture.</p>\n<p>Fratino’s new work for the Biennale, we were told, “carries an emotional weight that feels urgent, unveiling an additional layer of political response to the social climate queer people are facing everywhere.” While Obrist’s insistence on “urgency” came from the belief that making and discussing art was intrinsically important, the alleged urgency of Fratino’s work stems from the belief that, in these dangerous times, art can and should play an important role in resisting oppression. But it’s hard to detect any sense of political urgency in the tasteful old-fashioned aesthetic and aspirational settings of Fratino’s uniformly agreeable scenes of bourgeois gay life. <em>Cosmos and Miscanthus</em> is a still life of flowers in a vase, and below them, like fallen petals, some Polaroid nudes; <em>April (After Christopher Wood),</em> which borrows its composition from Wood’s 1930 painting <em>Nude Boy in a Bedroom,</em> depicts a naked painter in his apartment, the balcony door open to the trees in the garden; <em>Wine</em> warms a busy restaurant dining room with a half-drunk amber&nbsp;glow.</p>\n<p>Celebrations of identity made in such deeply traditional styles are progressive in content but conservative in form. They offer a <em>détournement</em> of cultural appropriation by trying to atone for the sins and omissions of the past with a series of art-historical pastiches: canonical art remade by artists with minority identities. Figurative artists of the past pieced together ideal bodies, took up motifs from the Bible and from mythology and history, crafted portraits of the ruling class, captured close likenesses, and conjured figures as emblems or expressions of the spirit of their age; today’s trending figurative painters make images of themselves. Once, we had painters of modern life; now we have painters of contemporary identities. And it is the fact of those identities—not the way they are expressed—that is understood to give value to our&nbsp;art.</p>\n<p>The extent to which the art world has taken up these concerns raises another question: When the world’s most influential, best-funded exhibitions are dedicated to amplifying marginalized voices, are those voices still marginalized? They speak for the cultural mainstream, backed by institutional authority. The project of centering the previously excluded has been completed; it no longer needs to be museums’ main priority and has by now been hollowed out into a trope. These voices have lost their own unique qualities. In a world with Foreigners Everywhere, differences have flattened and all forms of oppression have blended into one universal grief. We are bombarded with identities until they become meaningless. When everyone’s tossed together into the big salad of marginalization, otherness is made banal and abstract.</p>\n<p>Great art should evoke powerful emotions or thoughts that can be brought forth in no other way. If art merely conjured the same experience that could be attained through knowledge of the author’s identity alone, there would be no point in making it, or going to see it, or writing about it. If an artwork’s affective power derives from the artist’s biography rather than the work, then self-expression is redundant; when the self is more important than the expression, true culture becomes impossible.</p>\n<p><span>A</span>t the Whitney this year, art’s socially conscious turn attempted to claim every gesture as a kind of resistance or critique. One of the few works I enjoyed at the Biennial was Dora Budor’s playful experimental film<em> Lifelike,</em> which takes the viewer on a tour of Hudson Yards, the oft-maligned Manhattan megadevelopment a short walk up the High Line from the museum. Shot on a gimbal-mounted iPhone with a vibrator stuck to it, the video shows the new district shimmering like a mirage, the lights tracing circular trails, the architecture humming. It makes for pleasurable, comforting viewing, like visual ASMR, but what does it really have to say about the estranging effects of New York City real estate development? How is it that when Budor placed vibrators inside small, elegant wooden sculptures, as she did at the 2022 Venice Biennale, the work “interrelates industrial production, the privatization of pleasure, and the mechanics of biopolitical control,” whereas here “a vibrating pleasure device attached to the camera disturbs&nbsp;. . . serenity, suggesting an alienation commonly experienced in cities increasingly dominated by corporate architecture and gentrification”? How many forms of late-capitalist disaffection can one Magic Wand express? And isn’t Hudson Yards already a metonym for the dispiriting, suicide-inducing effects of corporate architecture? Isn’t that the most obvious observation, in fact, that one could make about&nbsp;it?</p>\n<p>When people from other walks of life used to tell me that they did not understand art, I would always reply that there is nothing to understand, there is no hidden meaning there to be deciphered. Lately, however, it has come to seem that there is. Budor’s room was adjacent to Charisse Pearlina Weston’s postminimalist suspended smoked-glass ceiling, which, the accompanying wall text explained, evokes “the ‘stall-in’ planned by the Brooklyn and Bronx branches of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to protest the 1964–65 New York World’s Fair” and explores “tactics of Black refusal.” Budor’s room led to Cannupa Hanska Luger’s upside-down hanging tepee, which, by “upending our grounding in time and space makes way for imagined futures free of colonialism and capitalism, where broader Indigenous knowledge can thrive.” Later on came Dionne Lee’s slapstick lo-fi first-person footage of herself walking hurriedly through a field with a dowsing rod. North American landscape painting has “typically taken a very broad view, with a distant horizon suggesting both optimism and colonizing force,” the wall text said. But Lee’s video “refuses that convention in favor of a more personal point of view, one that centers Black experiences of survival and the land.” Elsewhere was Karyn Olivier’s assemblage of found lobster traps from Maine, pot warp, and buoys hanging from a rope made of salt, which “invokes a memory of the work’s oceanic origin but also of the practice of trading salt for enslaved people in Ancient&nbsp;Greece.”</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it was hard to glean any of these alleged meanings from the works themselves. Rather, they could be discovered only from the descriptions on the wall, which read like the everything-is-connected code-breaking ravings of an overeducated cabal convinced that a hidden semiotic language of resistance lies below everyday objects, camera angles, orientations, and gestures made so very many times&nbsp;before.</p>\n<p><span>H</span>alf a century ago in these pages, Tom Wolfe complained that, as modern art became more abstract and de-objectified, and its interpretation more tightly prescribed by the era’s leading critics, the work’s appearance grew subordinate to the theory that purported to explain it, to words on a page. In the decades that followed, critics, artists, and curators alike began to frame contemporary artworks in relation to more or less every subgenre of contemporary philosophy—deconstruction, poststructuralism, speculative realism, accelerationism, pataphysics, psychogeography. Now, as the scope of art has narrowed dramatically, so too have the theoretical frameworks used to interpret it, and descriptions of work are dominated by the language of decolonial or queer&nbsp;theory.</p>\n<p>Critical claims have ceased to be about the art itself—as they were in Wolfe’s day—and now concern art’s capacity to drive political change. Not only has the art world embraced the magical spiritualities of the elders, but it has also returned to an old view that artworks can possess a mysterious, world-changing power; according to the texts issued by art institutions around the world, society’s ills might be healed through inclusivity, symbolic representations, and arcane, coded gestures. Reparations can be paid in images, guilt sloughed away with incomprehensible signifiers of accountability.</p>\n<p>We lie to one another and to ourselves that all this humdrum work is inspiring, that it has an influence on how opinions are formed and hearts are won, but, of course, it doesn’t. Nobody cares, which is partly why the exhibitions feel so lifeless. Few can even be bothered to protest the Whitney Biennial anymore, to call for the destruction of its paintings or the dissolution of its board; protesters don’t even bother to glue themselves to contemporary paintings to protest the oil industry—it wouldn’t draw enough attention or ire, so they target the old masters and the stars of modernity. Curators keep fighting a culture war that has already ended in the world&nbsp;outside.</p>\n<p>When I worked for Obrist, he held a twenty-four-hour marathon lecture series in which philosophers, industrial designers, historians, ecologists, novelists, landscape architects, and filmmakers would come and speak for fifteen minutes each. Back then, there was someone turning up at highbrow art events across London and throwing his shit at important people. It was my job at the lecture series to make sure Obrist remained excrement-free. Today, it’s impossible to imagine anyone wanting to do such a thing to a curator, to imagine anyone caring enough or even knowing whom to aim&nbsp;for.</p>\n<p><span>D</span>espite my jaundiced view of contemporary art, I do still encounter works that take me right out of the world. At Venice this year, I loved the installation artist Massimo Bartolini’s Italian Pavilion—one of the dozens of national pavilions at the Biennale that are curated independently of the large international group exhibition—featuring original compositions by musicians Caterina Barbieri, Kali Malone, and Gavin Bryars. Passing through the cavernous warehouse space, at the very end of the Arsenale shipyard, I heard a low hum coming from a handmade wooden bass organ pipe that ran most of the length of the brick-and-stone floor. Then, through a doorway, an automated organ-like music machine played a plaintive ambient lament through scaffolding pipes that extended into a fifty-meter-long mazelike installation. At its center was a circular pool filled with pulsating water; outside in the garden, a choral arrangement by Bryars and his son Yuri sounded from the trees. It was a marvelous experience and an unusual one, unlike any other I have had in the thousands of exhibitions I’ve visited in my life. It felt like a reverie, or a Paolo Sorrentino scene about the ecstasy and sadness of life. Bartolini’s architecture was irreducible to social or political messaging, and I found myself wishing there were more attempts to create utopian spaces or communities, to open minds up to new possibilities, and so make life feel more expansive.</p>\n<p>There were some extraordinary artists in the main exhibition, too: I felt transported by Rember Yahuarcani’s threatening mythical visions of pert-breasted rainforest creatures fucking one another while lynching songbird avatars of the European Union and the United States from their treetop gallows. His father, Santiago Yahuarcani, who like him comes from the White Heron clan of the Uitoto Nation, was also included in the show, and I admired his wild-all-over paintings of tribespeople seduced by many-titted Amazon mermaids blowing smoke into their mouths or devoured by chimeric animal spirits. This work, for me, brought to mind Giovanni da Modena’s extraordinary early-fifteenth-century fresco in Bologna’s Basilica of San Petronio depicting the devil and his demons eating sinners in hell. I was moved also by the crazy-eyed batik-dyed figures that Susanne Wenger drew with cassava-starch paste, attempting to give a form to Jungian archetypes, after studying in Vienna in the Thirties and immigrating to Nigeria in the Fifties, where she was initiated into the Yoruba religion. I relished the lush neon sensuality of Xiyadie’s paper-cut watercolors, his rapturous gay orgies in Beijing in which bodies are chained together like angels on a garland, and his unsettling self-portrait depicting his penis sewn up with rose-pink thread that grows into blooming&nbsp;flowers.</p>\n<p>What makes these artists great is not that they are foreigners, but rather that their visions are so foreign. They are self-taught outsiders who don’t neatly fit into any high-art or folk traditions: Santiago and Rember Yahuarcani’s imagery derives from indigenous folklore just as MAKHU’s alligator-bridge mural does, but while the latter is rendered in a childish, generic style, the White Heron clan painters combine mastery of technique with great formal experimentation, conjuring feverishly inventive beings that grow out of, and recede back into, their paintings’ energetic, patterned surfaces and structurally confusing dream spaces. Each shows us scenes from another world entirely, in a highly developed style that is entirely their own. All four of these artists have committed themselves to their very weird, singular visions, which are rendered with a palpable intensity that fills their crowded images from edge to edge. They create strange, dark fantasy scenes of violence, terror, lust, and perversity—the kinds of repressed and unspoken human desires that have appeared in art for thousands of years, but which are, for the most part, no longer welcome in the galleries. You can tell by looking at their works that they are searching for the something&nbsp;else.</p>\n<p><span>I</span>n the Nineties, when I was a student at a Christian boys’ school in Oxford, the art teacher showed us a video of a Viennese Actionist performance by Hermann Nitsch’s Das Orgien Mysterien Theater (“Theater of Orgies and Mystery”). As I remember it, the participants were naked, wrapped in white sheets, soaked in the blood of cows they had sacrificed, performing rituals in their commune in the Austrian countryside, accompanied by music, singing, dancing, and feasting. That’s how I came to understand the idea of modern art as transgressive.</p>\n<p>The performances of Das Orgien Mysterien Theater had nothing to do with personal identity or the imparting of information. They were, rather, attempts to leave social norms and Apollonian rationality behind and to embrace Dionysian chaos in the hopes of achieving catharsis. Artists have gone from trying to destroy reality, as in the days of the Dadaists, to attempting to reassert it and restore order today. But it is far too late. Consensus reality is gone. We are blessed to live now, in the West, in a strange world without common sense. As fact grows stranger than fiction, we should embrace the surreal and try harder to imagine more outlandish fictions. We might begin by accepting that we are being lied to all the time, that most of what we hear and see is an illusion, misrepresentation, or performance—and that’s fine. Life has in many ways become a fiction, reality is vanishing under its own representations, we are suffering from collective delusions, we are teetering on the precipice of the real, with a multiverse of fantasies spinning out beneath us—and that’s okay, that’s fine. Reality is gone, and the art crowd keeps trying to recover it, keeps claiming, “Oh, we can find it again, we can hold on to it, if we just keep exhibiting ceramics, if we just keep making paintings”—but we&nbsp;cannot!</p>\n<p>The unreality of the present moment should be a boon for artists and all who deal in the imagination. I don’t particularly care to have my awareness raised; I’d rather view art that tears open my consciousness, that opens portals into the mysterious. I like art the most when it doesn’t mean a thing, or otherwise when its beauty or strangeness transcends its subject. Stop making so much sense. Art should do more than communicate: it should move us; it should make us weep; it should bring us to our knees. It is, along with music, the purest expression of the human spirit. It is an important part of what makes us human—the most important part—and constitutes a continuum of yearning passed down the centuries that can be felt in every great museum or Renaissance&nbsp;chapel.</p>\n<p>Art is often best when it’s absolutely deranged. We are irrational, incoherent beings, and artists and writers should embrace this once more. If you believe that artworks cast spells, you should use that magic for greater causes than propagating a polite, liberal American sensibility or evading the effects of modern technology. You are free to dream anything. To build different worlds, to whisper enticements in many ears, to try to destroy reality; these are prospects that artists have dreamed of for centuries. There is still so much to&nbsp;imagine.</p>\n\n                            </div></div>",
